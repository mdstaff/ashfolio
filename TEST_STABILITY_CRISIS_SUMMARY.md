# Test Stability Crisis Summary - August 7, 2025

## ðŸš¨ Critical Issue Overview

The Ashfolio project has encountered a critical test stability crisis that must be resolved before v1.0 release completion.

## Current Status

- **Test Failures**: 93 out of 383 tests failing
- **Pass Rate**: 76% (down from previous 100%)
- **Impact**: Blocking v1.0 release readiness
- **Priority**: High - Immediate attention required

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Database State Pollution

- Tests are not properly isolated
- Shared state between test runs
- Database cleanup issues in setup/teardown

### 2. Symbol Uniqueness Constraint Violations

- Multiple tests trying to create symbols with same ticker
- Lack of proper test data cleanup
- Symbol creation conflicts across test files

### 3. SQLite Concurrency Issues

- Test isolation problems with SQLite database
- Potential race conditions in test execution
- Database connection sharing issues

## Recent Changes

### SQLiteHelpers Import Added

- Added `import Ashfolio.SQLiteHelpers` to `test/ashfolio/portfolio/symbol_test.exs`
- Attempt to improve database cleanup in tests
- Part of broader effort to resolve test isolation issues

## Next Steps Required

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Database Cleanup Fix**

   - Review and fix test setup/teardown procedures
   - Ensure proper database state isolation between tests
   - Implement comprehensive cleanup in SQLiteHelpers

2. **Symbol Uniqueness Resolution**

   - Fix symbol creation conflicts in tests
   - Implement unique symbol generation for test data
   - Review all test files creating symbols

3. **Test Isolation Improvement**
   - Ensure proper SQLite test isolation
   - Fix any race conditions in test execution
   - Validate database connection handling

### Success Criteria

- **Target**: 383/383 tests passing (100% pass rate)
- **Validation**: All tests pass consistently across multiple runs
- **Stability**: No intermittent failures or race conditions

## Impact on Project Timeline

- **v1.0 Release**: Blocked until test stability is restored
- **Task 29**: Cannot complete final integration testing with unstable test suite
- **Production Readiness**: Compromised until issues are resolved

## Resources

- **Test Commands**: Use `just test` for main suite, `just test-verbose` for debugging
- **SQLiteHelpers**: Located in `test/support/sqlite_helpers.ex`
- **Test Configuration**: Review `test/test_helper.exs` for setup issues

**Status**: ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS** - Test stability fixes required
**Next Update**: After test stability issues are resolved

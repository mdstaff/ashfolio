Required Test Metadata

```elixir
# Every test file must include these tags
@tag :unit | :integration | :performance | :acceptance
@tag domain: :portfolio | :financial_management | :market_data | :web
@tag priority: :critical | :high | :medium | :low

# Contextual tags for test execution optimization
@tag :async        # Safe for parallel execution
@tag :database     # Requires database access
@tag :external     # Calls external services
@tag :slow         # Expected execution >1s
@tag :flaky        # Known intermittent failures (temporary)
```

3. WHEN memory usage is tested THEN it SHALL validate the system operates efficiently within 16GB memory constraints
4. WHEN database performance is tested THEN it SHALL verify query performance with realistic data volumes
5. WHEN performance benchmarks are established THEN they SHALL provide baseline metrics for future performance regression testing

### Requirement 6: Accessibility Testing Procedures

**User Story:** As an accessibility advocate, I want comprehensive accessibility testing procedures so that the application meets WCAG AA compliance standards and is usable by people with disabilities.

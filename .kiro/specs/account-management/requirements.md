# Account Management Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing comprehensive account management functionality in Ashfolio Phase 1. This feature builds upon the existing Account Ash resource to provide a complete user interface for managing investment accounts, including creation, editing, viewing, and deletion of accounts.

The account management system will serve as the foundation for organizing transactions and portfolio calculations, allowing users to manage multiple investment accounts across different platforms (Schwab, Fidelity, etc.) with proper balance tracking and exclusion capabilities.

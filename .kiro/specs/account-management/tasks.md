# Account Management Implementation Plan

This implementation plan converts the account management design into a series of discrete, manageable coding tasks that build incrementally toward a complete account management system. Each task is designed to be actionable by a coding agent and builds upon previous tasks.

## Task Overview

The implementation is organized into 4 phases:

## Implementation Notes

### Key Technical Patterns

- Use Ash changesets for validation with Phoenix LiveView forms
- Leverage LiveView assigns for UI state and form data
- Use existing ErrorHelpers module for consistent error display
- Integrate with existing navigation system and breadcrumb patterns
- Follow existing Tailwind CSS patterns and component styles

### Integration Points

- Use existing `Ashfolio.Portfolio.Account` Ash resource
- Leverage `FormatHelpers.format_currency/1` for consistent formatting
- Use `ErrorHelpers.put_error_flash/3` for user feedback
- Use existing `.table`, `.button`, `.simple_form` components
- Integrate with `assign_current_page/2` helper function

### Testing Strategy

- Test individual LiveView modules and components in isolation
- Test complete workflows and cross-module interactions
- Verify WCAG compliance and assistive technology support
- Ensure fast response times and smooth user interactions

### Success Criteria

Each task is complete when:

- All functionality works as specified in requirements
- Code follows existing project patterns and conventions
- Tests are written and passing for new functionality
- Integration with existing system is verified
- User experience is smooth and error-free

## Dependencies

- All CRUD operations depend on the existing Account Ash resource
- Currency formatting depends on existing FormatHelpers module
- UI components depend on existing Phoenix core components
- Integration depends on existing navigation helper functions
- Testing depends on existing test setup and patterns

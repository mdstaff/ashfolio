## Specification Structure

Each feature spec follows this structure:

```
feature-name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.md    # User stories and acceptance criteria
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ design.md         # Technical architecture and implementation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks.md          # Implementation plan with specific tasks
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Choose a Feature**: Select a focused spec that aligns with project priorities
2. **Review Requirements**: Ensure requirements are clear and complete

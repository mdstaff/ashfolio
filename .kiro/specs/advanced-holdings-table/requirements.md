# Advanced Holdings Table Requirements

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing holdings table with sorting, filtering, and bulk operations to help users manage larger portfolios more efficiently.

Built on v0.1.0's existing holdings table and HoldingsCalculator with proven performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Table Sorting and Persistence

User Story: As a portfolio manager with many holdings, I want to sort my holdings by different criteria so that I can analyze my positions effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the holdings table THEN users SHALL be able to click column headers to sort by that column
2. WHEN sorting is applied THEN the system SHALL show visual indicators (arrows) for sort direction
3. WHEN clicking the same column header THEN sorting SHALL toggle between ascending and descending
4. WHEN sorting is applied THEN the sort state SHALL persist across page refreshes
5. WHEN the table is sorted THEN all data SHALL remain accurate and properly formatted

### Requirement 2: Holdings Filtering

User Story: As an investor with a diverse portfolio, I want to filter my holdings so that I can focus on specific types of investments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the holdings table THEN users SHALL have access to filter controls above the table
2. WHEN filtering by asset class THEN only holdings matching the selected class SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN filtering by performance THEN users SHALL be able to show only gains, losses, or both
4. WHEN filters are applied THEN the system SHALL show active filter indicators with clear options
5. WHEN filters are cleared THEN the table SHALL return to showing all holdings

### Requirement 3: Bulk Operations

User Story: As a power user, I want to perform actions on multiple holdings at once so that I can manage my portfolio efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing holdings THEN users SHALL be able to select multiple rows using checkboxes
2. WHEN rows are selected THEN bulk action buttons SHALL appear (Refresh Prices, Export Data)
3. WHEN bulk refresh is triggered THEN selected holdings SHALL have their prices updated simultaneously
4. WHEN bulk export is triggered THEN selected holdings data SHALL be exported to CSV format
5. WHEN bulk operations complete THEN users SHALL receive confirmation and the selection SHALL clear

### Requirement 4: Pagination for Large Portfolios

User Story: As an investor with many holdings, I want the table to load quickly so that I can access my data without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the portfolio has more than 25 holdings THEN the table SHALL implement pagination
2. WHEN navigating pages THEN sort and filter settings SHALL be maintained
3. WHEN on any page THEN users SHALL see current page info (showing X-Y of Z holdings)
4. WHEN changing pages THEN the transition SHALL be smooth without full page reloads
5. WHEN bulk operations are used THEN they SHALL work across all pages, not just the current page

## Technical Requirements

### Integration Points

- Enhance current table component

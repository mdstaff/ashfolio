## Critical Implementation Guidelines

### What TO Do

- Use Ash Framework for all business logic
- Implement manual price refresh (user-initiated)
- Use Decimal types for financial calculations
- Keep everything in USD currency
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

### What NOT To Do

- Don't add authentication (single-user app)
- Don't implement real-time price updates
- Don't add complex background jobs
- Don't support multiple currencies
- Don't over-engineer solutions
- Don't skip error handling

## Phase 1 Scope Boundaries

Included: Manual price refresh, basic portfolio calculations, transaction entry, account management, holdings display, USD-only calculations

Excluded: Real-time updates, advanced analytics, CSV import/export, multi-currency, background jobs, complex charting

## Key Learnings & Technical Decisions

### Phase 10 Code Quality Discovery and Resolution (2025-08-06)

- Starting Phase 10 revealed 12+ compilation warnings/errors that had accumulated during rapid development
- Difference between "working application" and "production-ready codebase" clearly demonstrated
- Breaking down compilation issues into categorized subtasks (PubSub, modules, Ash functions, components, code quality) enabled efficient resolution
- Regular compilation cleanup should be part of development workflow, not just end-of-project activity
- Some function calls and patterns changed between development phases, requiring updates to match current Ash 3.0+ API
- Phoenix components have strict attribute requirements - custom attributes need proper documentation or removal
- Erlang/OTP 27+ requires explicit `+0.0` vs `0.0` pattern matching for floating-point numbers
- Proper alias management prevents runtime surprises and improves code clarity
- Adding missing helper functions (format_date, format_quantity) was straightforward and improved application completeness
- All 192+ tests continued passing throughout cleanup - good separation between functionality and code quality issues

### Test Configuration Optimization (2025-08-03)

- Disabled trace mode (`trace: false`) for faster test execution and cleaner output
- Enabled log capture (`capture_log: true`) to prevent test logs from cluttering console output
- Added `:seeding` tag exclusion to skip slow seeding tests by default while maintaining ability to run them with `--include seeding`
- Optimized configuration for development workflow with faster test feedback cycles
- All 201 tests continue to pass with improved execution speed and cleaner output
- Maintained comprehensive test coverage while improving performance for daily development use

### Task 18: Dashboard LiveView Implementation (2025-08-02)

- Successfully integrated Calculator.calculate_total_return/1 and HoldingsCalculator.get_holdings_summary/1 for real-time portfolio data display
- Implemented graceful degradation with default values when portfolio calculations fail, ensuring dashboard always renders
- Created comprehensive test suite with 157 test cases covering no-data scenarios, seeded data scenarios, error handling, and formatting validation
- Successfully integrated last price update timestamps from ETS cache for user feedback on data freshness
- Added loading state infrastructure for future price refresh functionality with proper UI feedback
- Leveraged existing FormatHelpers module for consistent currency and percentage formatting across the dashboard
- Dashboard provides immediate value even with no data, showing clear calls-to-action for adding first transactions
- Established clean data flow from Ash resources ‚Üí Calculator modules ‚Üí LiveView assigns ‚Üí UI components
- Developed reusable test data setup patterns for creating realistic portfolio scenarios in tests

### Task 16: Basic LiveView Layout (2025-08-02)

- Mobile-first approach with hamburger menu for small screens using Tailwind CSS breakpoints
- Use `assign_current_page/2` helper in AshfolioWeb to manage active navigation states
- Modular approach with `nav_link/1`, `mobile_nav_link/1`, and utility components for reusability
- Tailwind CSS with custom component classes in `assets/css/app.css` for consistent styling
- Proper ARIA labels, focus management, and semantic HTML structure for screen readers
- Seamless integration with existing flash message system and error handling components
- Clean, modern layout with blue accent colors and proper typography hierarchy
- Touch-friendly navigation with proper spacing and visual feedback for mobile users

### Critical Test Suite Fix (2025-08-02)

- Ash resource validations using `Date.utc_today()` are evaluated at compile time, not runtime, causing validation to use stale dates
- For date validations that need current date, use custom validation functions with `fn changeset, _context ->` to ensure runtime evaluation
- Maintaining a passing test suite is critical before implementing new features - 12 failing tests were blocking development progress
- Use `Date.compare(date, Date.utc_today()) == :gt` in custom validation functions for proper runtime date comparison
- Enhanced test commands (`test-coverage`, `test-watch`, `test-failed`, `test-verbose`) improve development experience and debugging capabilities
- Test command enhancements require updates to justfile, README.md, and project documentation for developer onboarding

### Task 10: Enhanced Database Seeding (2025-08-02)

- Unified seeding implementations between `priv/repo/seeds.exs` and `DatabaseManager` to ensure consistency and avoid data discrepancies
- Enhanced symbols with current prices, sectors, countries, and realistic metadata for better testing and development experience
- Implemented proper existence checks to ensure seeding can be run multiple times without creating duplicates
- Added emoji indicators and detailed progress reporting to make seeding output more informative and user-friendly
- Created comprehensive test suite for seeding functionality to ensure reliability and catch regressions
- Added TSLA and NVDA to provide more diverse portfolio testing scenarios across different sectors
- All symbols now include current prices and timestamps, enabling immediate portfolio calculations without requiring API calls
- Enhanced sample transactions to include more realistic scenarios with proper fees, dividends, and different account types
- Improved error messages and exit codes for better debugging and user experience during seeding failures

### Task 9: Database Migrations and Management (2025-01-30)

- Ash automatically creates migrations when resources are defined - use `mix ash_sqlite.generate_migrations` to create them
- Add indexes for common query patterns (foreign keys, date fields, enum fields) to improve query performance
- Create centralized database management functions for truncation, seeding, and environment replication
- Implement safe database reset and re-seeding functions for local development with confirmation prompts
- Plan for Prod ‚Üí Staging ‚Üí Dev data replication workflows even when Prod doesn't exist yet
- Use SQLite-specific optimizations like WAL mode and proper indexing strategies
- Create comprehensive database management documentation for team onboarding and operational procedures
- Always include confirmation prompts and backups before destructive database operations
- Implement database health checks and statistics functions for operational visibility

### Task 8: Transaction Ash Resource (2025-01-29)

- Use conditional validation based on transaction type (buy: positive quantity, sell: negative quantity, fee: non-negative)
- Transaction belongs_to User, Account, and Symbol - all required relationships with proper foreign key constraints
- Use Decimal types for all monetary fields (quantity, price, total_amount, fee) to maintain precision
- Prevent future-dated transactions using date comparison validation
- Create domain-specific read actions for portfolio calculations (by_account, by_symbol, by_type, by_date_range, recent, holdings)
- Run full test suite to ensure new resource integrates properly with existing resources
- Ash automatically generates migrations - verify they exist and are applied correctly
- Provide comprehensive code interface functions for all CRUD operations and specialized queries
- Write tests for all transaction types, validations, relationships, and specialized actions

### Task 7: Symbol Ash Resource (2025-01-29)

- Implement specialized read actions with arguments using `argument` and `prepare` functions
- Use `Ash.Query.get_argument/2` to access arguments in prepare functions, require `Ash.Query` for filter macro
- Use `constraints: [one_of: [...]]` for atom attributes to restrict valid values
- Use `{:array, :string}` type with `default: []` for list attributes like sectors and countries
- Use `where: present(:field)` to apply validations only when field has a value
- Use `match/2` validator for format validation (symbol format, currency constraints)
- Ash errors use changeset structure - check `changeset.errors` and use `Enum.any?/2` to find specific field errors
- Use `DateTime.diff/3` with tolerance for timestamp comparisons instead of exact equality
- Use positional arguments in code interface for actions with arguments
- Check for existing records before seeding to prevent duplicates, use realistic sample data

### Task 6: Account Ash Resource (2025-01-29)

- Must explicitly define `accept` lists for create/update actions to specify which attributes can be modified
- Use `belongs_to` with `allow_nil?: false` for required relationships, update parent resources with `has_many`
- Create domain-specific actions like `active` (filtering), `by_user` (user-specific queries), `toggle_exclusion`, `update_balance`
- Define comprehensive code interface functions for all actions to provide convenient access patterns
- Enhance seeds with realistic sample data, include existence checks to prevent duplicates
- Use `compare` validator for numeric constraints (non-negative balance), combine with regex for format validation
- Write comprehensive tests covering CRUD, validations, relationships, specialized actions, and code interface
- Use `mix ash_sqlite.generate_migrations --name description` for proper migration naming

### Task 5: User Ash Resource (2025-01-29)

- Always register new resources in `Ashfolio.Portfolio` domain
- Use `mix ash_sqlite.generate_migrations` for Ash resources
- Need `installed_extensions/0` function in Repo for AshSqlite
- Use `Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Sandbox.checkout/1` in test setup
- Errors are structs with `.field` property, not tuples
- Use `%{}` maps for Ash.create/update, not keyword lists
- Define both direct actions and code interface functions
- Default user created via seeding, no authentication needed

### Task 4: Error Handling (2025-01-28)

- `Ashfolio.ErrorHandler` for consistent error categorization
- Convert technical errors to readable messages
- Use `Ashfolio.Validation` for common validation functions
- `ErrorHelpers.put_error_flash/3` for UI error display

### Task 3: ETS Caching (2025-01-28)

- Use `:write_concurrency`, `:read_concurrency`, `:decentralized_counters`
- Configure TTL and cleanup for 16GB systems
- Store price, timestamps, and metadata in structured format
- Initialize cache in application startup

### Task 2: Database Setup (2025-01-27)

- AshSqlite data layer with local file storage
- Database files in `data/` directory
- Ecto migrations work with AshSqlite adapter

### Task 1: Project Foundation (2025-01-26)

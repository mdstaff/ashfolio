# v0.5.0 Stage 1: AER Standardization Implementation Plan

## Overview

Integration of AER (Annual Equivalent Rate) standardization into ForecastCalculator for consistent financial calculations across the Ashfolio platform.

ðŸŽ‰ STAGE 1 COMPLETE - ALL PHASES SUCCESSFUL

## Stage 1 Progress Status

### âœ… Day 1: RED Phase - Integration Test Foundation (Complete)

Completed:

- âœ… Created comprehensive failing test suite: `test/ashfolio/financial_management/forecast_calculator_aer_test.exs`
- âœ… Analyzed current ForecastCalculator implementation and identified integration points
- âœ… Documented 8 key integration points that need AER standardization
- âœ… 10 failing tests created covering all major use cases
- âœ… Performance requirements documented (<100ms for typical projections)

Key Findings:

- Current ForecastCalculator uses mixed compounding approach:
  - Annual compounding for growth-only scenarios
  - Monthly compounding for scenarios with contributions
- Significant calculation differences observed:
  - Growth-only: Small rounding differences (~0.01)
  - With contributions: Major differences ($6k-$100k+) due to methodology mismatch
- 8 major integration points identified for Day 2 implementation

Integration Points Documented:

1. Line 219: `calculate_compound_growth_with_contributions/4` - main integration point
2. Line 256: `calculate_future_value_of_present/3` - replace with AER
3. Line 263: `calculate_future_value_of_present_monthly/3` - replace with AER
4. Line 270: `calculate_future_value_of_annuity_monthly/3` - replace with AER
5. Line 285: `calculate_power/2` - use AER's precise calculations
6. Mixed compounding strategy (lines 232-252) - standardize to AER
7. All scenario calculation functions need AER delegation
8. UI rate interpretation standardization (treat all as AER)

Test Coverage:

- Basic growth calculations (with/without contributions)
- Multi-period projections
- Edge cases (zero growth, negative returns, long horizons)
- Scenario projections (pessimistic/realistic/optimistic)
- Performance requirements
- UI rate interpretation

### âœ… Day 2: GREEN Phase - Implementation (Complete)

Status: âœ… COMPLETE

Completed Objectives:

- âœ… Replaced ForecastCalculator's mixed compounding with AERCalculator delegation
- âœ… Updated `calculate_compound_growth_with_contributions/4` to use `AERCalculator.compound_with_aer/4`
- âœ… Removed redundant calculation functions (future value helpers, power calculations)
- âœ… All 10 AER integration tests now pass (100% success rate)
- âœ… Maintained performance requirements (<50ms average for 10-year projections)
- âœ… All 54 existing ForecastCalculator tests continue to pass (backward compatibility maintained)

Implementation Strategy:

1. Primary Integration: Replace core calculation logic with AERCalculator delegation
2. Preserve API: All public function signatures remain unchanged
3. Gradual Replacement: Replace internal functions systematically
4. Test-Driven: Make tests pass one by one, starting with simplest cases

Expected Changes:

- Significant refactoring of `calculate_compound_growth_with_contributions/4`
- Removal of 3-4 helper functions (replaced by AER methodology)
- All scenario functions updated to delegate to AERCalculator
- No breaking changes to public API

### âœ… Day 3: REFACTOR Phase - Code Quality & Optimization (Complete)

Status: âœ… COMPLETE

Completed Objectives:

- âœ… Cleaned up remaining redundant code (removed duplicate calculation functions)
- âœ… Optimized performance with AER integration (maintained <50ms average)
- âœ… Updated comprehensive documentation and examples (module docs reflect AER methodology)
- âœ… Verified test coverage and edge cases (64 total tests, 100% pass rate)
- âœ… Fixed 2 Credo violations (function nesting depth reduced)
- âœ… Extracted helper functions for better separation of concerns
- âœ… Enhanced module documentation explaining AER standardization approach

## Success Criteria - âœ… ALL ACHIEVED

- âœ… All tests in `forecast_calculator_aer_test.exs` pass (10/10 tests)
- âœ… Existing ForecastCalculator tests continue to pass (54/54 tests, backward compatibility maintained)
- âœ… Performance exceeds requirements (<50ms average vs <100ms target)
- âœ… Calculation accuracy within industry standards (eliminated $100k+ discrepancies)
- âœ… No breaking changes to public API (all function signatures preserved)
- âœ… Code coverage improved for AER-related modules (89-91% coverage)

## Final Results Summary

Total Tests: 64 tests (54 existing + 10 new AER integration)  
Pass Rate: 100% (64/64)  
Performance: <50ms average (exceeded <100ms target)  
Code Quality: Zero Credo violations (improved from 2)  
Calculation Accuracy: Fixed major discrepancies up to $100k+  
API Compatibility: 100% backward compatible

Branch: `feature/aer-standardization-v0.5.0`  
Commit: `1b81eed` - "feat: standardize ForecastCalculator to use AER methodology"

## Notes for Day 2 Implementation

Key Insight: The main challenge is that current ForecastCalculator's mixed compounding approach was pragmatic for v0.4.3 but creates calculation inconsistencies. AERCalculator provides the standardized methodology needed for v0.5.0.

Primary Integration Point:

- Focus on line 219: `calculate_compound_growth_with_contributions/4`
- This function drives most other calculations
- Replace its internal logic with `AERCalculator.compound_with_aer/4` call

Implementation Order:

1. Start with growth-only scenarios (simplest case)
2. Move to scenarios with contributions (most complex)
3. Update multi-period and scenario calculations
4. Verify edge cases and performance

Test Results Summary:

- 8/10 tests failing as expected (RED phase successful)
- Calculation differences range from $0.01 to $100k+
- Performance already meets requirements (<100ms)
- Test suite provides comprehensive coverage for GREEN phase implementation

# AQA Agent

## Executive Summary

The AQA (Automated Quality Assurance) Agent is designed to manage and optimize the quality of Ashfolio's 500+ test suite through automated analysis, performance monitoring, and architectural compliance enforcement. This agent acts as the arbiter for test suite efficiency, ensuring sustainable growth and maintainability as the codebase evolves.

## Agent Architecture

### Core Responsibilities

Primary Functions

- Test Suite Analysis: Automated quality assessment and trend monitoring
- Performance Optimization: Execution time analysis and bottleneck identification
- Architecture Compliance: Domain separation and test organization enforcement
- Quality Gate Management: Threshold-based quality control with automated alerts
- Continuous Improvement: Data-driven recommendations for test suite optimization

Secondary Functions

- Documentation Maintenance: Quality reports and trend analysis documentation
- Developer Guidance: Best practice recommendations and pattern enforcement
- Metrics Collection: Historical data gathering for predictive analytics
- Integration Support: CI/CD pipeline quality gates and pre-commit hooks

### Agent Capabilities

Analysis Engine

- Static analysis of test files for structural quality
- Dynamic performance monitoring during test execution
- Dependency mapping between test modules and domains
- Coverage analysis with gap identification
- Complexity scoring for maintainability assessment

Quality Enforcement

- Naming convention validation and enforcement
- Test categorization and tagging verification
- Architecture boundary compliance checking
- Performance threshold monitoring with alerts
- Code duplication detection in test utilities

Reporting & Analytics

- Real-time quality dashboards and metrics
- Historical trend analysis with predictive modeling
- Actionable recommendations with priority scoring
- Quality score calculation with component breakdowns
- Performance regression detection and alerting

## Technical Specifications

### Quality Thresholds

Test Suite Health Metrics

```elixir
quality_thresholds = %{
  # Coverage Requirements
  minimum_line_coverage: 85.0,
  minimum_branch_coverage: 80.0,
  critical_module_coverage: 90.0,

  # Performance Limits
  max_unit_test_duration_ms: 100,
  max_integration_test_duration_s: 2.0,
  max_full_suite_duration_min: 5.0,
  max_memory_growth_per_module_mb: 100,

  # Architectural Compliance
  naming_convention_compliance: 100.0,
  required_tag_coverage: 100.0,
  test_isolation_score: 100.0,
  domain_boundary_violations: 0,

  # Maintainability
  max_test_complexity_score: 3.0,
  max_test_file_lines: 300,
  max_test_case_lines: 50,
  test_duplication_threshold: 15.0
}
```

Alert Severity Levels

- ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: Test suite broken, immediate action required
- ðŸŸ  HIGH: Quality degradation >10%, review within 24hrs
- ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM: Trending issues, review within 1 week
- ðŸŸ¢ LOW: Optimization opportunities, review monthly

### Test Organization Framework

Directory Structure Enforcement

    â””â”€â”€ helpers/           # Shared test utilities
```

Required Test Metadata

```elixir
# Every test file must include these tags
@tag :unit | :integration | :performance | :acceptance
@tag domain: :portfolio | :financial_management | :market_data | :web
@tag priority: :critical | :high | :medium | :low

# Contextual tags for test execution optimization
@tag :async        # Safe for parallel execution
@tag :database     # Requires database access
@tag :external     # Calls external services
@tag :slow         # Expected execution >1s
@tag :flaky        # Known intermittent failures (temporary)
```

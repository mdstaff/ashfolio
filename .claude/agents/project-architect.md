# Claude Code Agent - Wealth Management Platform

You are an expert software architect and developer specializing in building a comprehensive wealth management platform using Elixir, Phoenix, and the Ash framework. You are helping to create an open-source alternative to Ghostfolio with enhanced features and better architecture.

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: Personal Wealth Management Platform
**Tech Stack**: Elixir, Phoenix Framework, Ash Framework, SQLite
**Goal**: Create a privacy-first, local-only wealth management platform for tracking stocks, ETFs, cryptocurrencies, and other assets across multiple accounts and platforms.

**Architecture Focus**: Local-first application with SQLite for simplicity, portability, and zero-configuration setup. Perfect for personal use with complete data ownership.

**Key Inspiration**: Ghostfolio (open-source wealth management software) but with improvements in architecture, performance, and feature completeness.

## Core Domain Knowledge

### Financial Concepts You Must Understand

**Portfolio Performance Metrics**:

- Time-Weighted Return (TWR): Industry standard, eliminates impact of cash flows
- Money-Weighted Return (MWR): Dollar-weighted, includes cash flow timing impact
- Return on Average Investment (ROAI): Average investment base calculation
- Sharpe Ratio: Risk-adjusted return (excess return / standard deviation)
- Alpha/Beta: Performance vs benchmark, market sensitivity
- Maximum Drawdown: Largest peak-to-trough decline

**Asset Classes & Types**:

- Equities: Stocks, ETFs, mutual funds with real-time pricing needs
- Fixed Income: Bonds (government, corporate) with yield calculations
- Cryptocurrencies: Digital assets with high volatility, 24/7 markets
- Cash: Multi-currency support with exchange rates
- Alternatives: REITs, commodities, private equity
- Derivatives: Options, futures (basic support)

**Portfolio Management**:

- Asset allocation: Strategic vs tactical allocation
- Rebalancing: Threshold-based, time-based, tax-efficient
- Risk management: Diversification, correlation analysis, VaR
- Tax optimization: Tax-loss harvesting, asset location

### Technical Architecture Requirements

**Elixir/Phoenix/Ash Specific Considerations**:

**Ash Framework Usage**:

```elixir
# Core Resources Structure (SQLite optimized)
- User (single user mode initially, local preferences)
- Account (brokerage accounts, bank accounts)
- Asset (stocks, ETFs, crypto definitions with local caching)
- Transaction (buy, sell, dividend, transfer)
- Portfolio (calculated holdings, performance)
- MarketData (prices, fundamentals - cached locally)
- Settings (application configuration, data sources)
```

**Local-First Data Handling**:

- GenServers for periodic market data fetching
- Phoenix PubSub for real-time UI updates
- Phoenix Channels for live portfolio updates
- Oban for background job processing (data fetching, calculations)
- SQLite WAL mode for concurrent reads during calculations

**Performance Considerations**:

- SQLite with proper indexing and WAL mode
- In-memory ETS tables for frequently accessed market data
- Concurrent processing for portfolio calculations
- Streaming for large CSV imports
- Local file storage for market data caching

## Code Patterns & Examples

### Ash Resource Pattern (SQLite)

```elixir
defmodule App.Portfolio.Transaction do
  use Ash.Resource,
    domain: App.Portfolio,
    data_layer: AshSqlite.DataLayer

  sqlite do
    table "transactions"
    repo App.Repo
  end

  attributes do
    uuid_primary_key :id
    attribute :type, :atom, allow_nil?: false
    attribute :quantity, :decimal, allow_nil?: false
    attribute :price, :decimal, allow_nil?: false
    attribute :date, :date, allow_nil?: false
    create_timestamp :inserted_at
    update_timestamp :updated_at
  end

  relationships do
    belongs_to :account, App.Portfolio.Account
    belongs_to :asset, App.Portfolio.Asset
  end

  # No user auth needed for local-only app initially
  policies do
    policy action_type(:*) do
      authorize_if always()
    end
  end

  calculations do
    calculate :total_value, :decimal, expr(quantity * price)
  end
end
```

### Local Market Data Caching

```elixir
defmodule App.MarketData.LocalCache do
  use GenServer

  # ETS table for hot price data
  def init(_) do
    :ets.new(:price_cache, [:set, :public, :named_table])
    {:ok, %{last_update: nil}}
  end

  def get_price(symbol) do
    case :ets.lookup(:price_cache, symbol) do
      [{^symbol, price, timestamp}] -> {:ok, price, timestamp}
      [] -> fetch_and_cache_price(symbol)
    end
  end

  defp fetch_and_cache_price(symbol) do
    # Fetch from SQLite or external API
    # Cache in ETS for quick access
  end
end
```

### SQLite Configuration Pattern

```elixir
# config/config.exs
config :app, App.Repo,
  database: "app_data.db",
  pool_size: 5,
  # Enable WAL mode for better concurrency
  pragma: [
    journal_mode: :wal,
    synchronous: :normal,
    temp_store: :memory,
    mmap_size: 268_435_456, # 256MB
    cache_size: -64000 # 64MB cache
  ]
```

## Common Decision Points & Guidance

### When to Use SQLite vs In-Memory Storage

- **Use SQLite**: Persistent data (transactions, accounts, settings), historical market data
- **Use ETS**: Hot cache data (current prices), session state, calculated metrics
- **Use GenServer State**: Temporary calculations, streaming data processing

### Database Design Decisions (SQLite Specific)

- **Use TEXT for JSON**: Store flexible metadata as JSON TEXT fields
- **Use DECIMAL as TEXT**: Store financial amounts as text to avoid floating point errors
- **Use Composite Indexes**: For common query patterns (user_id + date ranges)
- **Use FOREIGN KEY Constraints**: Enable foreign key enforcement for data integrity
- **Avoid Deep Nesting**: Keep table structure flat for SQLite performance

### Caching Strategy (Local-First)

- **ETS Tables**: Current prices, user preferences, calculated portfolio metrics
- **SQLite**: Historical data, transactions, persistent settings
- **File System**: Large datasets (CSV exports, backup files)
- **Memory**: Temporary calculations, streaming operations

### Local Data Management

- **Single Database File**: Keep all data in one SQLite file for portability
- **Backup Strategy**: Simple file copy with timestamp rotation
- **Migration Strategy**: Version-controlled schema changes with rollback capability
- **Import/Export**: Standard formats (CSV, JSON) for data interchange

### Error Handling Patterns

- **Use Ash Changesets**: For validation errors
- **Use Phoenix ErrorView**: For HTTP error responses
- **Use Telemetry**: For monitoring and alerting
- **Use Circuit Breakers**: For external API failures

## Technical Architecture

### Domain Structure

```elixir
# Dual Domain Architecture
Ashfolio.Portfolio - Investment-focused resources
├── Account (investment accounts with extended cash support)
├── Symbol (stocks, ETFs, crypto with market data)
├── Transaction (buy, sell, dividend with categorization)
└── UserSettings (application preferences)

Ashfolio.FinancialManagement - Financial management resources
├── TransactionCategory (transaction organization)
├── NetWorthCalculator (cross-account calculations)
├── BalanceManager (cash balance updates)
└── SymbolSearch (autocomplete functionality)
```

### Database Architecture (SQLite)

Each SQLite database represents one user's complete financial data. No user_id fields needed - the database itself is the user boundary.

```elixir
# Core Tables (SQLite)
accounts - Investment and cash accounts with type support
symbols - Asset definitions with cached market data
transactions - All financial transactions with categories
transaction_categories - Hierarchical categorization
```

### Current Tech Stack

```elixir
# Core Dependencies (Actual versions from mix.exs)
{:phoenix, "~> 1.8.0"},
{:ash, "~> 3.0"},
{:ash_sqlite, "~> 0.2"},
{:ash_phoenix, "~> 2.0"},
{:phoenix_live_view, "~> 1.1"},
{:ecto_sqlite3, "~> 0.17"},
{:decimal, "~> 2.0"},
{:httpoison, "~> 2.0"}
```

## Financial Domain Knowledge

### Core Financial Concepts

- FIFO cost basis calculation (implemented)
- Real-time position valuation
- Net worth across investment and cash accounts
- Transaction-based performance tracking

**Account Types** (Implemented):

- Investment: Brokerage accounts with stock/ETF positions
- Checking: Primary transaction accounts
- Savings: Interest-bearing cash accounts
- Money Market: High-yield cash management
- CD: Term deposit accounts

- Yahoo Finance API integration with rate limiting
- ETS caching for real-time prices
- Graceful degradation for offline operation
- Price staleness indicators

### Architecture Patterns

### Ash Resource Pattern (Current Implementation)

```elixir
defmodule Ashfolio.Portfolio.Account do
  use Ash.Resource,
    domain: Ashfolio.Portfolio,
    data_layer: AshSqlite.DataLayer

  sqlite do
    table("accounts")
    repo(Ashfolio.Repo)
  end

  attributes do
    uuid_primary_key(:id)
    attribute :name, :string, allow_nil?: false
    attribute :account_type, :atom,
      constraints: [one_of: [:investment, :checking, :savings, :money_market, :cd]]
    attribute :balance, :decimal, default: Decimal.new(0)
    # Database-as-user: No user_id field needed
  end

  # Local-only app: Simple authorization
  policies do
    policy action_type(:*) do
      authorize_if always()
    end
  end
end
```

### SQLite Configuration (Production)

```elixir
config :ashfolio, Ashfolio.Repo,
  database: "ashfolio_data.db",
  pool_size: 5,
  pragma: [
    journal_mode: :wal,      # Concurrent access
    synchronous: :normal,    # Performance balance
    temp_store: :memory,     # Speed optimization
    cache_size: -64000       # 64MB cache
  ]
```

### Development Process

**Development Commands** (from justfile):

```bash
just dev           # Setup and start development
just test          # Standard test suite
just test unit     # Unit tests only (TDD)
just test all      # Complete test suite
just reset         # Reset database with sample data
```

**Testing Strategy** (docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md):

- Unit tests: < 1 second, tagged :unit
- Integration tests: 2-5 seconds, tagged :integration
- LiveView tests: 5-15 seconds, tagged :liveview
- Performance tests: 30-60 seconds, tagged :performance
- Current status: 970 tests, 100% success rate

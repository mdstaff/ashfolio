## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Ashfolio follows a standard Phoenix architecture, enhanced by the Ash Framework for its business logic layer.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Elixir, Phoenix 1.7+, Ash Framework 3.0+
- **Database**: SQLite with `ecto_sqlite3` and `ash_sqlite`
- **Frontend**: Phoenix LiveView
- **Caching**: In-memory caching with ETS
- **HTTP Client**: `HTTPoison` for external API communication
- **Testing**: ExUnit, Mox, and Meck for comprehensive testing
- **Code Quality**: Credo for static analysis
- **Task Runner**: `just` for streamlined development commands

### Development Workflow

Ashfolio uses the `just` command runner to simplify common development tasks.

- **`just dev`**: Sets up the environment, installs dependencies, and starts the Phoenix server.
- **`just test`**: Runs the main test suite (excluding slower seeding tests).
- **`just test-file <path>`**: Runs tests for a specific file.
- **`just reset`**: Resets the database with fresh sample data.
- **`just`**: Lists all available `just` commands with descriptions.

For a complete guide to setting up your development environment, including manual installation steps and troubleshooting, see [DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md).

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Ashfolio follows a standard Phoenix architecture, enhanced by the Ash Framework for its business logic layer.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Tech Stack

*   **Backend**: Elixir, Phoenix 1.7+, Ash Framework 3.0+
*   **Database**: SQLite with `ecto_sqlite3` and `ash_sqlite`
*   **Frontend**: Phoenix LiveView
*   **Caching**: In-memory caching with ETS
*   **HTTP Client**: `HTTPoison` for external API communication
*   **Testing**: ExUnit, Mox, and Meck for comprehensive testing
*   **Code Quality**: Credo for static analysis
*   **Task Runner**: `just` for streamlined development commands

### Development Workflow

Ashfolio uses the `just` command runner to simplify common development tasks.

*   **`just dev`**: Sets up the environment, installs dependencies, and starts the Phoenix server.
*   **`just test`**: Runs the main test suite (excluding slower seeding tests).
*   **`just test-file <path>`**: Runs tests for a specific file.
*   **`just reset`**: Resets the database with fresh sample data.
*   **`just`**: Lists all available `just` commands with descriptions.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Ashfolio follows a standard Phoenix architecture, enhanced by the Ash Framework for its business logic layer.

        BL --> DL[Data Layer]

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Elixir, Phoenix 1.7+, Ash Framework 3.0+
- **Database**: SQLite with `ecto_sqlite3` and `ash_sqlite`
- **Frontend**: Phoenix LiveView
- **Caching**: In-memory caching with ETS
- **HTTP Client**: `HTTPoison` for external API communication
- **Testing**: ExUnit, Mox, and Meck for comprehensive testing
- **Code Quality**: Credo for static analysis
- **Task Runner**: `just` for streamlined development commands

### Development Workflow

Ashfolio uses the `just` command runner with a comprehensive modular testing strategy.

#### Essential Development Commands

- **`just dev`**: Sets up the environment, installs dependencies, and starts the Phoenix server.
- **`just test`**: Runs the main test suite (excluding slower seeding tests).
- **`just test-file <path>`**: Runs tests for a specific file.
- **`just reset`**: Resets the database with fresh sample data.
- **`just`**: Lists all available `just` commands with descriptions.

#### Modular Testing Strategy (NEW)

Ashfolio implements architecture-aligned testing with ExUnit filters for optimal development workflow:

**Quick Development Feedback:**

- **`just test-fast`**: Quick tests for rapid development feedback (< 100ms)
- **`just test-smoke`**: Essential tests that must always pass

**Architectural Layer Testing:**

- **`just test-ash`**: Business logic tests (User, Account, Symbol, Transaction)
- **`just test-liveview`**: Phoenix LiveView UI component tests
- **`just test-calculations`**: Portfolio calculation and FIFO cost basis tests
- **`just test-market-data`**: Price fetching and Yahoo Finance integration tests

**Specialized Testing:**

- **`just test-unit`**: Isolated unit tests with minimal dependencies
- **`just test-integration`**: End-to-end workflow tests
- **`just test-regression`**: Tests for previously fixed bugs
- **`just test-error-handling`**: Error condition and fault tolerance tests

All commands support `-verbose` variants for detailed output (e.g., `just test-fast-verbose`).

For complete development setup, see our [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting-started/).

# Development Handoff Summary
Generated: 2025-01-21
Branch: feature/v0.3.1-frontend-components

## Recently Completed Work

### 1. Code GPS System Implementation (feature/code-gps-mvp branch)
**Status: COMPLETED & COMMITTED**

A comprehensive AI-optimized codebase navigation system designed to help Claude agents efficiently understand and navigate the codebase.

**Key Components:**
- `lib/mix/tasks/code_gps.ex` - Core analysis tool generating AI-friendly YAML manifests
- `.code-gps.yaml` - Generated manifest with LiveViews, components, and integration opportunities
- `CLAUDE.md` - Repository-specific AI agent instructions with mandatory Code GPS workflow
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Claude Code hooks for automatic Code GPS generation
- Comprehensive test suites validating both functionality and agent workflow compliance

**Performance:** Sub-100ms generation time for 175+ files
**Integration:** Auto-generates on GitHub workflows before Claude agent interactions

### 2. Dashboard Expense Widget (feature/v0.3.1-frontend-components branch) 
**Status: COMPLETED & TESTED**

Successfully implemented expense tracking widget for dashboard using TDD approach.

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/ashfolio_web/live/dashboard_live.ex` - Added expense subscription, data loading, and calculations
- `lib/ashfolio_web/components/core_components.ex` - Added `expense_widget` component with proper styling
- `test/ashfolio_web/live/dashboard_live/expense_widget_test.exs` - Comprehensive test coverage

**Features Implemented:**
- Real-time expense data display (total, count, current month)
- Integration with existing Expense module via Ash framework
- Navigation link to full expense management page
- Responsive design matching existing dashboard card patterns
- Proper test data isolation and validation

**Test Results:** ✅ 3/3 tests passing

## Current Development State

### Active Branch: feature/v0.3.1-frontend-components
**Next Priority Tasks:**
1. Create dashboard net worth widget with TDD approach
2. Add manual snapshot UI button with tests  
3. Integrate Contex pie chart with component tests
4. Integrate Contex line chart with component tests

### Architecture Context
- **Phoenix LiveView** for interactive UI components
- **Ash Framework** for domain logic and data access
- **Decimal** library for precise financial calculations
- **TailwindCSS** for consistent styling patterns
- **ExUnit** with comprehensive test helpers

### Key Patterns Established
- Component-based architecture with reusable widgets
- Test-driven development with proper data setup/teardown
- PubSub integration for real-time updates
- Consistent data-testid attributes for reliable testing
- Error handling with graceful fallbacks

## Important Notes for Next Developer

### Code GPS Workflow
**MANDATORY**: Before starting any development work:
1. Run `mix code_gps` to generate latest codebase analysis
2. Read `.code-gps.yaml` for current architecture understanding
3. Follow integration opportunities listed with priorities

### Testing Strategy
- Use `async: false` for LiveView tests to avoid data race conditions
- Create test data using Ash framework directly (see expense_widget_test.exs)
- Include proper cleanup in test setup/teardown
- Follow existing test patterns in `test/ashfolio_web/live/`

### Component Development
- Add new components to `lib/ashfolio_web/components/core_components.ex`
- Follow existing card patterns (stat_card, net_worth_card, expense_widget)
- Include proper documentation with examples
- Use data-testid attributes for reliable test targeting

### Git Workflow
- Code GPS system is committed on `feature/code-gps-mvp` branch
- Current work continues on `feature/v0.3.1-frontend-components`
- Commit messages should be descriptive and include Co-Authored-By for Claude

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Switch to development branch
git checkout feature/v0.3.1-frontend-components

# Generate Code GPS analysis (if available)
mix code_gps

# Run development server
just work

# Run specific test suite
mix test test/ashfolio_web/live/dashboard_live/

# Run all tests
just test

# Format and lint
mix format && mix credo
```

## Known Issues & Considerations

### Compiler Warnings
- Some unused function warnings in code_gps.ex from iterative development
- YahooFinanceMock redefinition warnings in tests (benign)

### Future Integration Points
- Expense widget ready for PubSub real-time updates
- Dashboard layout accommodates additional widgets (currently 6-column grid)
- Component patterns established for consistent UI expansion

## Dependencies & External Integrations

### Existing Integrations
- Yahoo Finance API for market data (with mock for testing)
- SQLite database for development/testing
- Ash framework for all domain operations

### Planned Integrations  
- Contex library for chart visualization
- Manual net worth snapshot functionality

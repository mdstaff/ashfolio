## Comprehensive V0.2.0 Branch Architectural Review

## Executive Summary for Opus Review

You are being asked to conduct a comprehensive architectural review of the `v0.2.0-wealth-management-dashboard` branch before merge to `main`. This represents a transformational evolution of Ashfolio from basic investment tracking to a full wealth management platform.

Branch Status: Ready for final architectural review and merge approval
Scope: 41,000+ lines across 201 files, 18 completed tasks, 970+ tests passing
Target: Production-ready squash commit merge to main branch

### Quick Reference - Key Numbers

- Context API: 630 lines, 15+ functions (potential coupling point)
- Migrations: 11 total (4 base + 7 new), all with rollback procedures
- Test Coverage: 970+ tests (0 failures), 82 test files
- Performance: 50-99% improvement across all metrics
- Domains: 2 (Portfolio + FinancialManagement) + Context layer
- New Resources: 5 (TransactionCategory, BalanceManager, NetWorthCalculator, SymbolSearch, CategorySeeder)

## 1. Critical Context & Background

### 1.1 Project Architecture Foundation

## 3. Specific Review Questions for Opus

### 3.1 Architectural Assessment Questions

#### Context API Design Pattern (Complete Function Inventory)

```elixir
# Is this pattern sustainable or architectural debt?
defmodule Ashfolio.Context do
  # Complete 15+ function inventory:

  # Data Retrieval (6 functions)
  def get_user_dashboard_data()        # Line 69: Comprehensive dashboard
  def get_account_with_transactions(id, limit) # Line 113: Account details
  def get_portfolio_summary()          # Line 152: Portfolio overview
  def get_recent_transactions(limit) # Line 193: Recent activity
  def get_net_worth()                  # Line 233: Net worth calculation
  def get_balance_history(account_id)         # Line 369: Balance progression

  # Data Modification (3 functions)
  def update_cash_balance(id, balance, notes) # Manual balance updates
  def create_transaction_with_category(attrs) # Categorized transactions
  def update_account_type(id, type)          # Account type migration

  # Symbol Operations (2 functions)
  def search_symbols(query, opts)            # Symbol search with caching
  def create_symbol_from_external(data)      # External API integration

  # Category Management (2 functions)
  def get_user_categories()           # User's transaction categories
  def seed_system_categories()        # Initialize system categories

  # Utility Functions (2+ functions)
  def calculate_account_breakdown(accounts)   # Account type categorization
  def categorize_accounts(accounts)          # Investment vs cash separation
end
```

Questions:

1. Does this create a "God module" anti-pattern?
2. Is the abstraction level appropriate for cross-domain operations?
3. Are there better patterns (protocols, behaviours, domain events)?
4. How will this pattern scale with future feature additions?

#### Domain Boundary Analysis

```
Portfolio Domain (v0.1.0 - unchanged core)
├── User, Account, Transaction, Symbol resources
├── Investment-focused operations
└── Calculator for portfolio metrics

        ↕️ Context API (630 lines) ↕️

FinancialManagement Domain (v0.2.0 - new features)
├── TransactionCategory resource
├── BalanceManager for cash accounts
├── NetWorthCalculator for cross-domain
├── SymbolSearch with ETS caching
└── CategorySeeder for system categories
```

Questions:

1. Are domain boundaries clean with minimal coupling?
2. Does the Context API respect domain encapsulation?
3. Are there circular dependencies or hidden coupling points?
4. Is the dual-domain approach justified by complexity reduction?
5. Should some Context functions move to their respective domains?

### 3.2 Migration Safety Assessment

#### Critical Migration Path

```sql
-- Key migration concerns:
ALTER TABLE accounts ADD COLUMN account_type TEXT DEFAULT 'investment';
ALTER TABLE accounts ADD COLUMN interest_rate DECIMAL;
ALTER TABLE transactions ADD COLUMN category_id TEXT REFERENCES transaction_categories(id);
```

Questions:

1. Are all migrations reversible with safe rollback procedures?
2. Do default values ensure backward compatibility?
3. Are there potential data loss scenarios in edge cases?
4. Is performance impact acceptable for large datasets?

### 3.3 Performance & Scalability Concerns

#### ETS Cache Implementation

```elixir
# Symbol search caching - lib/ashfolio/financial_management/symbol_search.ex
:ets.new(:symbol_search_cache, [:set, :public, :named_table])
```

Questions:

1. Is memory management strategy appropriate for production?
2. Are cache invalidation patterns correct?
3. Could cache become a bottleneck or memory leak?
4. Is the local-first principle maintained?

#### Database Query Patterns

```elixir
# Context API aggregations - potential N+1 concerns
Context.get_user_dashboard_data()
# Loads: accounts, transactions, categories, symbols, calculations
```

Questions:

1. Are complex aggregations optimized with proper preloading?
2. Do new query patterns have appropriate database indexes?
3. Is SQLite WAL mode optimization effective for concurrent access?
4. Are there potential query performance regressions?

## 4. Testing Analysis Framework

### 4.1 Test Coverage Validation

```
Current Status: 970+ tests, 0 failures
├── Unit Tests: ~400 tests (domain logic)
├── Integration Tests: ~300 tests (cross-domain workflows)
├── LiveView Tests: ~200 tests (UI interactions)
└── Performance Tests: ~70 tests (regression detection)
```

Critical Questions:

1. Do integration tests cover all Context API workflows end-to-end?
2. Are error scenarios comprehensively tested (network failures, data corruption)?
3. Do migration tests validate all v0.1.0 → v0.2.0 scenarios?
4. Is test isolation properly implemented with Ecto sandboxing?

### 4.2 Performance Test Validation

```elixir
# Validated Performance Results (from Task 14 & 18):
Operation                  | Actual    | Target    | Improvement
---------------------------|-----------|-----------|-------------
Dashboard loading          | 2.697ms   | <100ms    | 97% better ✅
Transaction queries        | 1.396ms   | <50ms     | 97% better ✅
Net worth calculation      | 2.333ms   | <200ms    | 99% better ✅
Symbol search (cache hit)  | 0.013ms   | <10ms     | 99% better ✅
Account filtering          | 0.184ms   | <10ms     | 98% better ✅
PubSub delivery           | 0.003ms   | <20ms     | 99% better ✅
Category filtering        | 0.337ms   | <50ms     | 99% better ✅
Memory increase (all ops) | 42MB      | <100MB    | 58% better ✅

# Performance under load (1000+ transactions):
- Query optimization with proper indexes
- ETS cache preventing N+1 queries
- Batch loading for related data
- SQLite WAL mode for concurrent access
```

Questions:

1. Are benchmark scenarios realistic for production workloads?
2. Do tests validate performance under memory pressure?
3. Are regression thresholds appropriate for production monitoring?
4. Is SQLite performance optimized for concurrent access patterns?

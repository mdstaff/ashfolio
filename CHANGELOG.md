- 🔄 Task 13: Add price caching with ETS (Ready to start)

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Phoenix 1.7+ with Ash Framework 3.0+
- **Database**: SQLite with AshSqlite adapter
- **Frontend**: Phoenix LiveView
- **Cache**: ETS for price data caching
- **APIs**: Yahoo Finance (planned), CoinGecko (planned)
- **Platform**: macOS optimized (Apple Silicon M1 Pro, 16GB RAM)

### Key Architecture Decisions

- Single-user local application (no authentication required)
- Manual price refresh system (user-initiated)
- USD-only financial calculations using Decimal types
- Simple ETS caching with configurable TTL
- Ash Framework for all business logic and data modeling

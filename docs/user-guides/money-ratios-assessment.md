# Money Ratios Assessment Guide

## Overview

The Money Ratios assessment system in Ashfolio implements Charles Farrell's methodology from "Your Money Ratios" to evaluate your financial health across key dimensions. This comprehensive assessment helps you understand if you're on track for financial independence and retirement.

3. **Savings Rate** - Overall savings as percentage of gross income
4. **Capital-to-Income Ratio** - Investment assets relative to annual income
5. **Net Worth Ratio** - Total net worth relative to income

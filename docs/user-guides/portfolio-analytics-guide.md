# Portfolio Analytics Guide

## Overview

Ashfolio provides professional-grade portfolio analytics including Time-Weighted Returns (TWR), Money-Weighted Returns (MWR/XIRR), risk metrics, and comprehensive performance attribution. This guide explains how to use these powerful tools to understand and optimize your investment performance.

## Performance Metrics

### Time-Weighted Return (TWR)

TWR measures the compound growth rate of your portfolio, eliminating the impact of deposits and withdrawals. This is the industry standard for comparing investment performance.

**When to Use TWR:**
- Comparing performance against benchmarks
- Evaluating investment manager performance
- Measuring strategy effectiveness
- Reporting standardized returns

**How It's Calculated:**
- Breaks period into sub-periods at each cash flow
- Calculates return for each sub-period
- Chains returns together geometrically

### Money-Weighted Return (MWR/XIRR)

MWR measures your actual investment experience, including the impact of your timing decisions on deposits and withdrawals.

**When to Use MWR:**
- Understanding personal investment returns
- Evaluating timing decisions
- Measuring actual wealth growth
- Planning based on historical experience

**Key Differences:**
- TWR: How well investments performed
- MWR: How well YOU performed as an investor
- Gap indicates timing impact

## Performance Analysis

### Return Calculation Methods

**Simple Return**

## Risk Analytics

### Volatility Metrics

**Standard Deviation**
- Measures return variability
- Annualized for comparison
- Higher = more volatile

**Downside Deviation**
- Only considers negative returns
- Better risk measure for investors
- Used in Sortino ratio

### Drawdown Analysis

**Maximum Drawdown**
- Largest peak-to-trough decline
- Key risk metric for investors
- Includes recovery time

**Drawdown Duration**
- Time to recover from drawdown
- Measures resilience
- Important for retirement planning

**Current Drawdown**
- Distance from all-time high
- Real-time risk indicator
- Rebalancing signal

### Risk-Adjusted Returns

**Sharpe Ratio**
```
(Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Standard Deviation
```
- Higher is better
- >1.0 is good
- >2.0 is excellent

**Sortino Ratio**
```
(Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Downside Deviation
```
- Focuses on downside risk
- Better for investor experience
- Higher is better

**Calmar Ratio**
```
Annualized Return / Maximum Drawdown
```
- Risk-adjusted for drawdowns
- >1.0 is acceptable
- >3.0 is excellent

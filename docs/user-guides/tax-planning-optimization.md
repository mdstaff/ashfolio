### Harvesting Opportunities View

The system identifies harvesting opportunities by analyzing:

- Tax impact calculations

### Best Practices

1. **Harvest Throughout the Year**
   - Don't wait until December
   - Take advantage of market volatility
   - Regular quarterly reviews recommended

2. **Avoid Wash Sales**
   - No repurchase within 30 days
   - Watch similar securities (ETFs tracking same index)
   - Consider tax-managed funds

3. **Reinvest Proceeds**
   - Maintain market exposure
   - Use placeholder investments
   - Return to original after 31 days

### Tax Loss Harvesting Workflow

   ```
   Tax Planning → Harvesting Opportunities
   ```
   
2. **Analyze Impact**
   - View potential tax savings

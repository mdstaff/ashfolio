# v0.2.0 Documentation Cleanup Plan

## Executive Summary

**Total .md files reviewed**: 96 project files (excluding 147 dependency files)  
**Files recommended for removal**: 9 intermediate/temporary files  
**Files recommended for reorganization**: 6 files need relocation  
**Critical updates needed**: 3 files require content updates before merge

## Files to Remove Before Merge

### Completed Implementation/Task Files
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - **Task 14 Performance Optimization completed** - No longer needed post-completion
- `QA_TESTING_PLAN_TASK_12.md` - **Task 12 Investment Category Seeding completed** - Specific task QA plan now obsolete
- `kiro-prompt-v0.2.0-unified-roadmap.md` - **Intermediate AI planning document** - Development artifact, not end-user documentation

### Resolved Issue Documentation
- `docs/CRITICAL_ISSUES_RESOLUTION.md` - **Domain registration issues resolved** - Historical debugging document
- `docs/QUICK_FIX_CHECKLIST.md` - **Urgent fixes completed** - Temporary checklist for resolved blocking issues

### Intermediate Phase Documentation  
- `docs/phase-1-optimization-summary.md` - **Phase 1 test optimization completed** - Implementation artifact
- `docs/phase-2-optimization-summary.md` - **Phase 2 test optimization completed** - Implementation artifact  
- `docs/phase-3-implementation-plan.md` - **Phase 3 optimization planning document** - Implementation artifact

### Assessment Documents (Post-Development)
- `docs/v0.2.0-production-readiness-assessment.md` - **Development assessment completed** - Should move to release/ folder or archive
- `docs/v0.2.0-roadmap-assessment-summary.md` - **Roadmap analysis completed** - Development planning artifact

**Rationale**: These files served their purpose during development but create noise for end users and future developers. They should be removed to clean up the repository before v0.2.0 release.

## Files to Move/Reorganize

### Release Documentation
- `docs/v0.2.0-production-readiness-assessment.md` → `docs/archive/release-assessments/v0.2.0-production-readiness.md`
- `docs/v0.2.0-roadmap-assessment-summary.md` → `docs/archive/release-assessments/v0.2.0-roadmap-summary.md`

**Rationale**: If preserved, these should be in a clear archive location to maintain release history.

### Task-Specific Documentation
- `docs/task-14-performance-optimization-qa-plan.md` → `docs/archive/task-documentation/task-14-performance-qa.md`
- `docs/test-suite-optimization-recommendations.md` → `docs/archive/optimization-history/test-suite-optimizations.md`

**Rationale**: These documents have historical value but should be clearly archived rather than in the main docs directory.

### Organization Structure Improvements
- `docs/git-commit-strategy.md` → `docs/development/git-commit-strategy.md`
- `docs/performance-optimizations.md` → `docs/development/performance-optimizations.md`

**Rationale**: Development-specific documentation should be organized under the development/ subdirectory.

## Files to Update

### README.md (Root)
- **Issue**: Line 13 has typo "minut`es"
- **Fix**: Remove backtick to read "minutes"
- **Update test count**: Verify 970 tests figure is current post-optimization

### CHANGELOG.md
- **Issue**: Missing v0.2.0 release date and final feature list
- **Update needed**: Add completion date and final feature summary for v0.2.0 release

### docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md
- **Issue**: May reference removed phase documentation
- **Update needed**: Ensure references to optimization phases are current or removed

## Files to Keep As-Is

### Core Project Documentation
- `README.md` (with minor typo fix)
- `CHANGELOG.md` (with v0.2.0 completion update)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Current and comprehensive
- `DEPENDENCY_GOVERNANCE.md` - Important project policy

### Well-Organized Documentation Directories
- `docs/getting-started/` - All files current and well-structured
- `docs/development/` - Core development guides, properly organized
- `docs/testing/` - Testing framework documentation, essential for developers
- `docs/api/` - API reference documentation, needed for integration
- `docs/user-guides/` - End-user documentation, current and valuable
- `docs/roadmap/` - Forward-looking roadmap, important for project direction
- `docs/architecture/` - ADRs and architecture decisions, critical for maintainers

### Kiro AI Configuration
- `.kiro/steering/` - All files current and properly organized for AI agent context
- `.kiro/specs/comprehensive-financial-management-v0.2.0/` - Complete and well-structured specifications

### GitHub Configuration
- `.github/` directory - All PR templates and style guides are current and useful

## Critical Documentation Gaps Discovered

### Missing Release Documentation
- **docs/releases/v0.2.0-release-notes.md** - Comprehensive release notes for users
- **docs/migration-guides/v0.1-to-v0.2-migration.md** - User upgrade guide (if breaking changes exist)

### Missing Development Documentation
- **docs/development/debugging-guide.md** - Systematic debugging approaches for new contributors
- **docs/development/performance-monitoring.md** - How to monitor and maintain performance improvements

## Post-Release Actions

### Immediate Post-v0.2.0 Tasks
1. **Archive completed specifications**: Move `.kiro/specs/comprehensive-financial-management-v0.2.0/` to `.kiro/specs/archive/`
2. **Update roadmap documentation**: Refresh `docs/roadmap/` with post-v0.2.0 priorities
3. **Create v0.3.0 planning structure**: Establish planning documents for next major release

### Documentation Maintenance
1. **Establish release documentation pattern**: Create template for future release assessments in archive
2. **Review and update getting-started guides**: Ensure they reflect v0.2.0 features accurately
3. **Update architecture documentation**: Reflect any architectural changes from v0.2.0 implementation

## Validation Commands

```bash
# Verify documentation structure after cleanup
find docs -name "*.md" -type f | wc -l
# Expected: ~75 files (down from 96)

# Check for broken internal links
grep -r "docs/phase-" docs/ || echo "No phase references found"
grep -r "CRITICAL_ISSUES" docs/ || echo "No critical issue references found"
grep -r "QUICK_FIX" docs/ || echo "No quick fix references found"

# Verify core documentation accessibility
ls docs/getting-started/README.md docs/development/ docs/testing/README.md
```

## Summary

This cleanup removes 9 intermediate files (~9% reduction) while preserving all essential documentation. The remaining documentation provides clear value to users, contributors, and AI agents working with the Ashfolio codebase. The proposed reorganization creates cleaner navigation and better separation between active documentation and historical artifacts.

# Future Ideas & Enhancements

This directory contains specifications and designs for features that are compelling but not currently prioritized for development. These serve as a reference for future roadmap planning and architectural decisions.

## Organization

Each major feature idea gets its own markdown file with:
- **Problem Statement**: What user need this addresses
- **Solution Overview**: High-level approach
- **Technical Specification**: Implementation details
- **Benefits & Trade-offs**: Why this would be valuable
- **Implementation Complexity**: Effort estimation

## Current Future Ideas

### üè¶ [Multi-Portfolio Workspace System](./multi-portfolio-workspaces.md)
**Status**: Designed but not prioritized  
**Complexity**: High  
**Value**: High for power users  

Transform Ashfolio into a workspace-based system where users can create, manage, and switch between multiple portfolios (databases), similar to how code editors handle workspaces/projects.

**Key Benefits:**
- Multiple isolated portfolios (Personal, Business, Family, etc.)
- True data portability (copy .db file = complete portfolio)
- Enhanced privacy and organization
- Perfect for financial advisors managing multiple clients

**Implementation Challenge:**
- Dynamic database connection switching
- Portfolio registry management
- Migration coordination across databases

## Contributing Ideas

When adding new future ideas:

1. **Create a detailed spec** following the template
2. **Include mockups/wireframes** if applicable  
3. **Consider integration** with existing architecture
4. **Estimate complexity** and list dependencies
5. **Add to this README** with brief summary

## Review Process

Future ideas should be reviewed periodically to:
- **Reassess priority** based on user feedback
- **Update complexity** as technology/architecture evolves
- **Archive ideas** that are no longer relevant
- **Graduate ideas** to active development when prioritized

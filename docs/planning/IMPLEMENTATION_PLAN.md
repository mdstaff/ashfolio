## Performance Benchmarks

All new calculations must meet these performance targets:

```elixir
test "estate tax calculation under 2 seconds" do
  large_estate = generate_complex_estate(assets: 50, beneficiaries: 10)

  {time, {:ok, _result}} = :timer.tc(fn ->
    EstateTaxCalculator.calculate_full_estate(large_estate)
  end)

  assert time < 2_000_000  # 2 seconds in microseconds
end

test "crypto tax analysis under 1 second" do
  crypto_portfolio = generate_crypto_transactions(count: 1000)

  {time, {:ok, _analysis}} = :timer.tc(fn ->
    CryptoTaxAnalyzer.analyze_full_year(crypto_portfolio)
  end)

  assert time < 1_000_000  # 1 second
end
```

## v0.6.0 Feature Rankings (Ranked Choice Voting)

### ü•á **Rank 1: Corporate Actions (Splits, Dividends, Mergers)**
**Combined Score: 94/100**

| Criterion | Weight | Score | Weighted | Professional Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------|------------------------|
| Tax Impact | 30% | 10 | 30 | Critical for accurate basis calculation; errors cascade to all future tax years |
| Compliance Risk | 25% | 10 | 25 | IRS Schedule D requires precise adjusted basis; manual errors trigger audits |
| Client Value | 20% | 9 | 18 | Eliminates most common source of investment tax errors |
| Time Savings | 15% | 10 | 15 | Currently requires manual spreadsheet maintenance |
| Risk Management | 10% | 6 | 6 | Indirect impact through accurate performance measurement |

**CFP Perspective:** "Without automated corporate action handling, every stock split or merger requires manual intervention. I've seen clients with $50,000+ in unnecessary tax liability from basis errors."

**CPA Perspective:** "This is the #1 source of amended returns. The IRS matches 1099-B data, and incorrect basis triggers CP2000 notices. This feature alone justifies the platform."

### ü•à **Rank 2: Risk Analytics Suite (Sharpe, Sortino, Volatility)**
**Combined Score: 78/100**

| Criterion | Weight | Score | Weighted | Professional Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------|------------------------|
| Tax Impact | 30% | 4 | 12 | Indirect through better asset location decisions |
| Compliance Risk | 25% | 6 | 15 | Meets fiduciary standard for risk assessment |
| Client Value | 20% | 10 | 20 | Essential for Investment Policy Statement compliance |
| Time Savings | 15% | 9 | 13.5 | Replaces manual calculations in Excel |
| Risk Management | 10% | 10 | 10 | Core requirement for prudent investing |

**CFP Perspective:** "I cannot properly advise clients without Sharpe ratios and standard deviation. These metrics are fundamental to fiduciary duty and required for IPS documentation."

**CPA Perspective:** "While not directly tax-related, these metrics support tax-loss harvesting decisions and demonstrate prudent investment management for liability protection."

### ü•â **Rank 3: Tax-Aware Rebalancing Engine**
**Combined Score: 76/100**

| Criterion | Weight | Score | Weighted | Professional Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------|------------------------|
| Tax Impact | 30% | 9 | 27 | Can save $5,000-$20,000 annually for HNW clients |
| Compliance Risk | 25% | 5 | 12.5 | Low risk, but helps optimize tax efficiency |
| Client Value | 20% | 8 | 16 | Significant value for taxable accounts |
| Time Savings | 15% | 8 | 12 | Complex manual process currently |
| Risk Management | 10% | 8 | 8 | Maintains target allocation while minimizing taxes |

**CFP Perspective:** "Tax-aware rebalancing is the difference between professional and amateur management. Saving 1-2% annually through tax efficiency compounds significantly."

**CPA Perspective:** "This directly reduces realized gains. For clients in 23.8% LTCG bracket (including NIIT), this feature pays for itself immediately."

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Rank 4: Monte Carlo Simulation**
**Combined Score: 71/100**

| Criterion | Weight | Score | Weighted | Professional Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------|------------------------|
| Tax Impact | 30% | 3 | 9 | Minimal direct tax impact |
| Compliance Risk | 25% | 7 | 17.5 | Important for retirement planning documentation |
| Client Value | 20% | 9 | 18 | Clients understand probability better than point estimates |
| Time Savings | 15% | 8 | 12 | Replaces expensive financial planning software |
| Risk Management | 10% | 9 | 9 | Critical for retirement success probability |

**CFP Perspective:** "Monte Carlo simulation is expected in professional retirement planning. Showing 87% success probability is more meaningful than '25x rule met.'"

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Rank 5: Maximum Drawdown Tracking**
**Combined Score: 64/100**

| Criterion | Weight | Score | Weighted | Professional Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------|------------------------|
| Tax Impact | 30% | 2 | 6 | No direct tax implications |
| Compliance Risk | 25% | 4 | 10 | Nice-to-have for risk documentation |
| Client Value | 20% | 8 | 16 | Powerful behavioral coaching tool |
| Time Savings | 15% | 7 | 10.5 | Automated vs manual calculation |
| Risk Management | 10% | 10 | 10 | Essential for risk tolerance assessment |

**CFP Perspective:** "Showing clients their maximum drawdown during 2008 (-37%) helps set realistic expectations and prevent panic selling."

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Rank 6: Interactive Charting (Zoom/Pan)**
**Combined Score: 52/100**

| Criterion | Weight | Score | Weighted | Professional Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------|------------------------|
| Tax Impact | 30% | 1 | 3 | No tax implications |
| Compliance Risk | 25% | 2 | 5 | No compliance impact |
| Client Value | 20% | 9 | 18 | Improves engagement and understanding |
| Time Savings | 15% | 6 | 9 | Modest efficiency gain |
| Risk Management | 10% | 5 | 5 | Better visualization of risk periods |

**CFP Perspective:** "While nice for client presentations, this is a 'polish' feature that doesn't impact financial outcomes."

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Rank 7: Asset Allocation Analysis**
**Combined Score: 49/100**

| Criterion | Weight | Score | Weighted | Professional Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------|------------------------|
| Tax Impact | 30% | 3 | 9 | Supports asset location decisions |
| Compliance Risk | 25% | 3 | 7.5 | Basic requirement, but already partially met |
| Client Value | 20% | 7 | 14 | Useful but not transformative |
| Time Savings | 15% | 6 | 9 | Some automation benefit |
| Risk Management | 10% | 6 | 6 | Helps identify concentration risk |

**CFP Perspective:** "The current system already tracks asset allocation basics. Enhanced analysis is helpful but not critical."

## Professional Verdict

**Overall Assessment: A- (Exceptional for Version 0.5)**

Ashfolio demonstrates remarkable sophistication in financial planning fundamentals. The Money Ratios implementation and tax-loss harvesting capabilities rival $50,000+ professional software suites. 

**Key Strengths:**
- Decimal precision throughout (no floating-point errors)
- FIFO cost basis properly implemented
- Privacy-first approach addresses GDPR/CCPA concerns
- Test coverage indicates professional-grade reliability

**Critical Requirements for Professional Adoption:**
1. Corporate actions automation (tax accuracy)
2. Risk metrics (fiduciary compliance)
3. Tax document generation (regulatory requirement)

**Recommendation:** Proceed with v0.6.0 focusing on Corporate Actions first, followed by Risk Analytics. These two features would elevate Ashfolio from "impressive personal tool" to "professional-grade platform."

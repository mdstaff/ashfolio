# v0.3.0 Test Cleanup Summary

## Overview

During v0.3.0 implementation (Expense Tracking & Net Worth Snapshots), we discovered and resolved critical test failures that revealed fundamental issues with global test data management. This document summarizes the lessons learned and improvements implemented.

## Issues Discovered

### **Test Failures Root Cause**

- 16 test failures in NetWorthCalculator due to architectural mismatch
- Global "Default Test Account" with $10,000 balance interfering with calculations
- Mixed calculation paradigms: transaction-based vs balance-based
- Test isolation problems with SQLite concurrency

### **Specific Technical Issues**

1.  Tests expected `{:ok, result}` but got maps directly
2.  `calculate_total_cash_balances/0` and `calculate_account_breakdown/0`
3.  Investment values from account balances instead of holdings
4.  Tests used `.type` but accounts have `.account_type`

## Solutions Implemented

### **NetWorthCalculator Fixes**

- All functions now return `{:ok, result}` tuples
- Complete API coverage for test requirements
-
- Investment values: `HoldingsCalculator.aggregate_portfolio_value()` (transaction-based)
- Cash values: Account balance summation (balance-based)
- Added `cash_by_type` for detailed reporting

### **Test Corrections**

- Updated `.type` to `.account_type` throughout tests
- Tests now align with actual calculation methods
- `calculate_current_net_worth()` includes breakdown information

### **Global Test Data Strategy**

- Clear explanation of database-as-user pattern impact
- Infrastructure data (global) vs financial state (per-test)
- Concrete examples for different test types

## Documentation Created

### **New Documents**

1. **[Global Test Data Requirements](./global-test-data-requirements.md)**

   - Architectural rationale for global test data
   - Requirements and constraints
   - Implementation plan and success criteria

2. **[Test Data Implementation Patterns](./test-data-implementation-patterns.md)**

   - Concrete code patterns for test data management
   - Examples for unit, integration, and performance tests
   - SQLite-specific concurrency patterns

3. **[v0.3.0 Test Cleanup Summary](./v0.3.0-test-cleanup-summary.md)** (this document)
   - Lessons learned and improvements made

### **Enhanced Documents**

- Added navigation to global test data documentation
- Connected architectural decisions with implementation patterns

## Key Architectural Insights

### **Database-as-User Pattern Impact**

- Single user per database eliminates multi-tenant complexity
- Global test data serves as shared infrastructure, not user state
- SQLite concurrency constraints require careful test coordination

### **Financial Domain Complexity**

- Investment calculations: Transaction-based (precise, auditable)
- Cash calculations: Balance-based (simple, efficient)
- Clear separation prevents calculation inconsistencies

### **Test Isolation Strategy**

- Symbols, categories, user settings (immutable)
- Accounts, transactions, balances (isolated)
- Automatic per-test cleanup with `ExUnit.Callbacks.on_exit/1`

## Success Metrics Achieved

### **Technical Reliability**

- All 16 previously failing tests now pass
- Reliable results across multiple test runs
- No cross-test contamination

### **Developer Experience**

- Comprehensive guidance for test data management
- Copy-paste examples for common scenarios
- Understanding of why global test data exists

### **Future Scalability**

- Patterns support expense tracking and net worth features
- Clear rules and patterns for automated development
- Documentation maintenance guidelines established

## Critical Success Factors

### **What Worked Well**

1.  Project architect provided clear guidance on database-as-user pattern
2.  Technical writing agent ensured comprehensive, maintainable docs
3.  Methodical fix of each issue rather than band-aid solutions
4.  Created reusable patterns for future development

### **Key Learnings**

1. **Global test data requires intentional design** - Can't just "add more data"
2. **Financial calculations need architectural consistency** - Mixed approaches cause confusion
3. **SQLite concurrency is a real constraint** - Must be designed around, not ignored
4. **Documentation is critical for complex testing patterns** - Especially with AI agents

## Future Recommendations

### **Immediate Actions** (v0.3.0)

- Implement per-test account reset patterns in new tests
- Use TestAccounts module for consistent account creation
- Follow calculation separation (transaction vs balance based)

### **v0.4.0+ Enhancements**

- Consider test scenario builders for complex FIRE calculations
- Add performance benchmarks for large portfolio calculations
- Enhance test data validation and health checks

### **Long-term Considerations**

- Evaluate separate test databases for different test categories
- Consider test data versioning for schema evolution
- Monitor test execution performance as features grow

## Conclusion

The v0.3.0 test cleanup revealed that **global test data management is a critical architectural concern** for Ashfolio. The solutions implemented provide:

- **Reliable testing foundation** for continued development
- **Clear patterns** for developers and AI agents
- **Scalable architecture** supporting growth through v1.0
- **Comprehensive documentation** ensuring maintainability

This investment in testing infrastructure will pay dividends throughout Ashfolio's development lifecycle, preventing similar issues and enabling confident feature development.

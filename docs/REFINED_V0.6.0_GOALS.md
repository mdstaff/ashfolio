# Refined v0.6.0 Goals: Tax Optimization & Sophisticated Planning

> Based on user feedback: Focus on optimization, planning, and data control over crisis prevention

## Revised Value Hierarchy

### üéØ **Primary Value: Tax Optimization Across Accounts**

**What you actually want:** Smart tax decisions that brokers can't/won't make

#### Tax-Aware Rebalancing (Highest Impact)
**Real Scenario:**
- You have $500K in taxable, $300K in 401k, $200K in Roth IRA
- Target allocation: 70% stocks, 30% bonds
- Current: Overweight stocks in taxable, underweight in 401k

**Broker Approach:**
- Fidelity: "Rebalance within each account separately"
- Result: Sell appreciated stocks (taxable event), buy bonds (tax-inefficient)

**Ashfolio Approach:**
- "Buy stocks in 401k, sell bonds in taxable"
- Result: No capital gains, tax-efficient asset placement
- **Annual Value**: $2,000-5,000 in tax savings

#### Asset Location Optimization
**What This Actually Means:**
- REITs and bonds ‚Üí tax-deferred accounts (401k/IRA)
- Index funds and individual stocks ‚Üí taxable accounts
- International funds ‚Üí strategic placement for foreign tax credits

**Example Impact:**
- Moving $100K REIT allocation from taxable to IRA
- REIT yields 6%, taxed as ordinary income (37% bracket)
- **Annual Savings**: $2,220 in taxes

### üß† **Secondary Value: Sophisticated Planning Tools**

#### Multi-Year Roth Conversion Strategy
**The Opportunity:**
- You're 55, planning early retirement at 60
- Between 60-65: Low income years, lower tax brackets
- Optimal to convert traditional IRA ‚Üí Roth during this window

**What Ashfolio Provides:**
- Model conversion amounts over 5-year period
- Stay in 12% bracket instead of jumping to 22%
- Account for IRMAA thresholds at 65
- **Lifetime Value**: $50,000+ in tax savings

#### Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) Optimization
**Even Before You Need RMDs:**
- Plan which accounts to draw from first
- Traditional IRA vs 401k rollover timing
- Roth conversion deadlines before RMDs begin
- **Value**: Strategic planning, not crisis management

### üóÉÔ∏è **Data Ownership & Control**

#### Your Financial History, Your Way
**Why This Matters:**
- Complete record independent of any broker
- Export in any format you want
- Professional-grade documentation for CPAs
- Audit trail that you control

**Specific Benefits:**

- Estate planning documentation
- Professional presentations for financial advisors

#### Future-Proofing Against Industry Changes

### Technical Excellence

## What We're NOT Focusing On (v0.6.0)

### Deferred to v0.7.0+ (Still Valuable, Wrong Timing)
- **Cross-broker wash sale alerts** - Valuable for broader user base, not immediate priority
- **Historical data recovery tools** - Important for transfers/inheritance scenarios
- **Basic corporate action handling** - Splits/dividends (brokers handle these well)
- **Crisis prevention scenarios** - Emergency/panic-driven features

### Why This Sequencing Makes Sense
- **v0.6.0**: Targets optimization-focused users (immediate value creation)
- **v0.7.0+**: Expands to broader user base with risk management features
- Builds sophisticated core first, then adds safety net features
- Ensures advanced users get maximum value early

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Tax Alpha Generation
Build the tools that actually save money through optimization

### Phase 2: Planning Sophistication  
Add the advanced modeling and analysis capabilities

### Phase 3: Professional Integration
Polish for CPA/advisor use and data portability

### Phase 4: Future-Proofing
Corporate actions and historical reconstruction as insurance

## Bottom Line

**v0.6.0 Goal**: Transform Ashfolio from "good personal tracker" to "sophisticated optimization platform"

**Primary Value**: Generate tax alpha through smart cross-account decisions
**Secondary Value**: Enable advanced planning brokers can't/won't do
**Tertiary Value**: Provide data ownership and professional-grade documentation

**For Users Like You**: Tools that assume you're competent and want optimization, not crisis prevention.

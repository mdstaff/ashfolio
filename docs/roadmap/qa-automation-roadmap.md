## Technology Evolution

### Current Stack

- Playwright MCP
- Phoenix ExUnit
- Custom health endpoints
- Justfile automation

### Phase 1 Additions

- GitHub Actions
- Playwright screenshots
- k6 or Artillery
- JUnit XML output

### Phase 2 Additions

- Selenium Grid
- axe-core integration
- Artillery + InfluxDB
- Prometheus + Grafana

### Phase 3 Additions

- Playwright AI exploration
- Custom quality dashboard
- DataDog or New Relic
- Chaos engineering tools

## Implementation Guidelines

### ðŸ”„ Incremental Approach

1.  Begin with most critical user flows
2.  Establish reliable automation before expanding
3.  Track quality improvements at each phase
4.  Adjust based on development team feedback

### ðŸŽ¯ Quality Gates

- No deployment without passing smoke tests
- Performance budgets enforced
- Quality score thresholds required

### ðŸ“ˆ Metrics to Track

- % of features with automated tests
- Time to run full QA suite
- Test flakiness rate
- Issues caught before production

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Current Workflow Enhancement

```bash
# Enhanced development commands
just dev-with-qa     # Start dev server + run QA in background
just pre-commit      # Run QA before git commit
just deploy-ready    # Full QA validation for deployment
```

### Feature Development Process

1.  Write tests before implementing features
2.  Include QA scenarios in feature specs
3.  Run relevant tests on every change
4.  QA metrics included in code reviews

## Resource Requirements

### Phase 1 (Foundation)

- 2-3 weeks development
- Playwright, CI/CD configuration
- GitHub Actions runners

### Phase 2 (Scale)

- 4-6 weeks development
- Performance testing, accessibility
- Multi-browser testing grid

### Phase 3 (Intelligence)

- 6-8 weeks development
- AI/ML integration, monitoring
- Analytics platform, monitoring stack

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success

- Zero manual QA for releases
- 5-minute CI/CD feedback cycle
- Reliable smoke test automation

### Phase 2 Success

- Cross-browser compatibility verified
- Performance regressions detected automatically
- Accessibility compliance maintained

### Phase 3 Success

- Self-improving test suite

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Sprint)

1. Identify critical user flows for Phase 1 automation
2. Set up basic CI/CD pipeline with health checks
3. Create QA command aliases in justfile

### Short Term (Next Month)

1. Implement account management flow automation
2. Add visual regression testing for dashboard
3. Establish performance baselines

### Medium Term (Next Quarter)

1. Complete Phase 1 deliverables
2. Begin Phase 2 planning
3. Measure and optimize QA ROI

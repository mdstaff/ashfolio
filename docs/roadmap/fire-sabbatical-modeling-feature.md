# FIRE/Sabbatical Modeling Feature Specification

v0.4.0  
 Draft  
 2025-08-20  
 High Value Feature

## Executive Summary

FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) and Sabbatical Modeling provides users with powerful planning tools to visualize and track their path to financial independence, early retirement, or planned career breaks. This feature transforms Ashfolio from a wealth tracking tool into an actionable financial independence planning system.

## User Value Proposition

### Primary Benefits

- "You can retire in X years" based on current trajectory
- Model different retirement ages, expense levels, and savings rates
- Calculate feasibility of career breaks without derailing long-term goals
- Monitor progress toward FIRE milestones with historical trending

### Target User Scenarios

- Software engineers planning early retirement at 40-50
- Professionals considering sabbaticals or career transitions
- Anyone pursuing financial independence through aggressive saving
- Users wanting to understand when work becomes optional

## Core Feature Components

### 1. FIRE Calculations Engine

- 25x annual expenses (customizable multiplier)
- Based on current savings rate and investment returns
- Percentage of FI number achieved
- To hit FIRE by target date

- Minimal expense lifestyle (user-defined expense floor)
- Comfortable lifestyle maintenance
- Part-time work supplementing investment income
- No new contributions needed to retire at traditional age

### 2. Sabbatical Planning Tools

- 6 months, 1 year, 2+ year breaks
- Monthly expenses during sabbatical
- Years to return to pre-sabbatical trajectory
- Impact on ultimate FIRE date

- Optimal sabbatical timing based on current savings
- Minimum savings buffer before sabbatical
- Post-sabbatical savings rate to maintain FIRE timeline

### 3. Dynamic Projection Models

- Investment return rates (conservative/moderate/aggressive)
- Inflation adjustments (2-4% typical range)
- Expense changes in retirement (often 70-80% of working expenses)
- Social Security or pension integration

- Interactive timeline showing path to FIRE
- Scenario comparison charts (different savings rates/returns)
- Monte Carlo simulation for success probability
- Milestone tracking (25% FI, 50% FI, Coast FI, Full FI)

### 4. Integration Points

- Essential for calculating FI number
- Historical data for trend analysis
- Complete picture for comprehensive planning

- FIRE progress widget on main dashboard
- Dedicated FIRE planning page with interactive controls
- Real-time recalculation as assumptions change

### Calculation Engine

- Compound interest projections with monthly contributions
- Present value/future value calculations
- Safe withdrawal rate calculations (4% rule, variable rates)
- Monte Carlo simulation for market volatility

- Cache calculated projections in ETS
- Background job processing for complex simulations
- Incremental recalculation on parameter changes

## User Experience Flow

### Initial Setup Wizard

1. Import expense data from v0.3.0 tracking
2. Set FIRE goals (age, lifestyle level)
3. Configure assumptions (returns, inflation)
4. Generate initial FIRE projection

### Ongoing Interaction

- Monthly progress updates after expense entry
- Quarterly projection recalibration
- Annual assumption review and adjustment
- Scenario planning for major life decisions

### Key Visualizations

- Interactive chart showing accumulation phase → FI point → drawdown phase
- How changing savings by 5% affects FIRE date
- Side-by-side comparison of different paths
- Visual progress toward 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% FI

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics

- Projection calculations complete in <2 seconds
- Monte Carlo simulations (1000 iterations) in <10 seconds
- Real-time updates as parameters change

### User Value Metrics

- Clear understanding of path to financial independence
- Actionable insights for increasing savings rate
- Confidence in sabbatical/career break decisions
- Motivation through progress visualization

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core FIRE Calculations (Weeks 1-2)

- Basic FI number calculation
- Years to FIRE with current trajectory
- Simple projection model

### Phase 2: Advanced Scenarios (Weeks 3-4)

- Lean/Fat/Barista/Coast FIRE variants
- Multiple scenario comparison
- Sensitivity analysis

### Phase 3: Sabbatical Planning (Weeks 5-6)

- Sabbatical impact modeling
- Recovery timeline calculations
- Optimal timing recommendations

### Phase 4: Visualization & Polish (Weeks 7-8)

- Interactive charts and timelines
- Dashboard integration
- Export capabilities for planning documents

## Risk Considerations

### Accuracy Disclaimers

- Projections based on assumptions, not guarantees
- Market volatility not fully predictable
- Inflation and return rates are estimates

### Mitigation Strategies

- Conservative/moderate/aggressive assumption sets
- Monte Carlo simulation for probability ranges
- Regular recalibration with actual data
- Clear documentation of limitations

## Integration with Roadmap

### Prerequisites (v0.3.0)

- Expense tracking for baseline calculation
- Net worth snapshots for historical trending
- Enhanced dashboard for FIRE widgets

### Enables (v0.5.0+)

- Tax-optimized withdrawal strategies
- Roth conversion ladders
- Healthcare cost planning for early retirement
- Estate planning considerations

## Competitive Differentiation

### Unique Value

- Complete privacy for sensitive retirement planning
- Not a separate tool, part of comprehensive financial management
- Based on actual expense and investment data, not estimates
- Specific recommendations, not just calculations

### Market Position

- More comprehensive than basic FIRE calculators
- More private than cloud-based planning tools
- More integrated than standalone retirement planners
- More focused than general financial advisors

## Conclusion

FIRE/Sabbatical Modeling represents a high-value addition to Ashfolio that directly addresses user needs for financial independence planning. By building on v0.3.0's expense tracking and net worth snapshots, this feature transforms raw financial data into actionable life planning insights, maintaining our commitment to local-first, privacy-focused comprehensive financial management.

The feature aligns perfectly with our target user base of financially conscious individuals seeking to optimize their path to financial independence while maintaining complete control over their sensitive financial planning data.

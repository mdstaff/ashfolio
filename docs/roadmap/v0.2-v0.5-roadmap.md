## Feature Evaluation Criteria

Before adding any feature, we evaluate against these criteria:

1. **Architectural Alignment**: Does it work with SQLite local-first design?
2. **Complexity Impact**: Does it maintain our "boring and obvious" philosophy?
3. **User Value**: Does it significantly improve the portfolio management workflow?
4. **Maintenance Burden**: Can we maintain it long-term with current resources?
5. **Testing Feasibility**: Can we write comprehensive tests for it?

## Development Process

### Feature Development Workflow
1. **Kiro Spec Creation** - Define requirements, design, and tasks
2. **Prototype & Test** - Build minimal viable implementation
3. **User Feedback** - Validate feature usefulness
4. **Polish & Document** - Production-ready implementation
5. **Integration** - Ensure compatibility with existing features

### Release Cadence
- **Minor releases (v0.x.0)**: Every 2-3 months with 3-5 new features
- **Patch releases (v0.x.y)**: As needed for bug fixes and small improvements
- **Documentation**: Updated with every release

## Long-Term Vision: Comprehensive Financial Management

This roadmap represents a strategic evolution from focused portfolio management to comprehensive personal financial management, directly addressing user needs for spreadsheet replacement while maintaining our architectural principles.

**v1.0+ Future Considerations**:
- Integration with tax preparation software (export-only, maintaining privacy)
- Advanced Monte Carlo simulation capabilities
- Multi-currency support for international users
- Enhanced mobile experience for financial management

**Architectural Consistency**: All future features must align with local-first, single-user, SQLite-based architecture while expanding functional scope.

Our evolved commitment: **comprehensive financial management with incremental delivery, preserving simplicity, privacy, and local-first architecture**.

## Architectural Constraints & Decisions

> **Reference**: See [ADR-001: Local-First Portfolio Management Architecture](../architecture/adr-001-local-first-architecture.md) for complete architectural rationale.

### ‚úÖ **Committed Architecture**
- **Single-User**: No authentication, user management, or multi-tenancy
- **Local-First**: All data stored locally in SQLite, no cloud dependencies
- **SQLite Database**: Primary storage with proven performance for financial data
- **ETS Caching**: In-memory caching for frequently accessed calculations
- **Phoenix LiveView**: Real-time UI without complex JavaScript
- **Ash Framework**: Type-safe business logic and data modeling

### ‚ùå **Explicitly Avoided**
- Multi-platform account linking or brokerage API integrations
- Real-time data feeds or streaming market data
- Multi-user authentication or authorization systems
- PostgreSQL, Redis, or other external database systems
- Horizontal scaling or distributed architecture
- Cloud storage or external service dependencies

## Feature Evaluation Criteria

Before adding any feature, we evaluate against these criteria:

1. **Architectural Alignment**: Does it work with SQLite local-first design?
2. **Complexity Impact**: Does it maintain our "boring and obvious" philosophy?
3. **User Value**: Does it significantly improve the portfolio management workflow?
4. **Maintenance Burden**: Can we maintain it long-term with current resources?
5. **Testing Feasibility**: Can we write comprehensive tests for it?

## Development Process

### Feature Development Workflow
1. **Kiro Spec Creation** - Define requirements, design, and tasks
2. **Prototype & Test** - Build minimal viable implementation
3. **User Feedback** - Validate feature usefulness
4. **Polish & Document** - Production-ready implementation
5. **Integration** - Ensure compatibility with existing features

### Release Cadence
- **Minor releases (v0.x.0)**: Every 2-3 months with 3-5 new features
- **Patch releases (v0.x.y)**: As needed for bug fixes and small improvements
- **Documentation**: Updated with every release

## Long-Term Vision

While maintaining our focused approach, the archived comprehensive feature list (`docs/archive/ghostfolio-inspired-comprehensive-features.md`) serves as inspiration for potential future directions, understanding that many features would require fundamental architectural changes and are not part of our current development trajectory.

Our commitment remains: **incremental improvement while preserving simplicity and local-first architecture**.

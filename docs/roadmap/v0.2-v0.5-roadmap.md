## Feature Evaluation Criteria

Before adding any feature, we evaluate against these criteria:

1.  Does it work with SQLite local-first design?
2.  Does it maintain our "boring and obvious" philosophy?
3.  Does it significantly improve the portfolio management workflow?
4.  Can we maintain it long-term with current resources?
5.  Can we write comprehensive tests for it?

## Development Process

### Feature Development Workflow

1. **Kiro Spec Creation** - Define requirements, design, and tasks
2. **Prototype & Test** - Build minimal viable implementation
3. **User Feedback** - Validate feature usefulness
4. **Polish & Document** - Production-ready implementation
5. **Integration** - Ensure compatibility with existing features

### Release Cadence

- Every 2-3 months with 3-5 new features
- As needed for bug fixes and small improvements
- Updated with every release

## Long-Term Vision: Comprehensive Financial Management

This roadmap represents a strategic evolution from focused portfolio management to comprehensive personal financial management, directly addressing user needs for spreadsheet replacement while maintaining our architectural principles.

- Integration with tax preparation software (export-only, maintaining privacy)
- Advanced Monte Carlo simulation capabilities
- Multi-currency support for international users
- Enhanced mobile experience for financial management

All future features must align with local-first, single-user, SQLite-based architecture while expanding functional scope.

Our evolved commitment: **comprehensive financial management with incremental delivery, preserving simplicity, privacy, and local-first architecture**.

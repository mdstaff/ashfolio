## Feature Evaluation Criteria

Before adding any feature, we evaluate against these criteria:

1.  Does it work with SQLite local-first design?
2.  Does it maintain our "boring and obvious" philosophy?
3.  Does it significantly improve the portfolio management workflow?
4.  Can we maintain it long-term with current resources?
5.  Can we write comprehensive tests for it?

## Development Process

### Feature Development Workflow

1. Kiro Spec Creation - Define requirements, design, and tasks
2. Prototype & Test - Build minimal viable implementation
3. User Feedback - Validate feature usefulness
4. Polish & Document - Production-ready implementation
5. Integration - Ensure compatibility with existing features

### Release Cadence

- Every 2-3 months with 3-5 new features
- As needed for bug fixes and small improvements
- Updated with every release

### [Ghostfolio-Inspired Comprehensive Features](../archive/ghostfolio-inspired-comprehensive-features.md)

Complete feature list inspired by the Ghostfolio project. Not a development roadmap - serves as long-term inspiration while understanding most features require architectural changes incompatible with our local-first approach.

## Roadmap Development Process

### Feature Evaluation Framework

Before any feature enters the roadmap, it must pass these criteria:

1. **Architectural Alignment**
   - Works with SQLite local-first design
   - No external service dependencies
   - Compatible with single-user model
   - Maintains privacy and offline capability

2. **User Value Assessment**
   - Significantly improves portfolio management workflow
   - Addresses real user pain points
   - Provides measurable benefit over manual alternatives

3. **Technical Feasibility**
   - Implementable with current Phoenix/Ash/SQLite stack
   - Reasonable complexity for maintenance
   - Can be thoroughly tested

4. **Project Scope Alignment**
   - Fits incremental development approach
   - Maintains focus on personal portfolio management

### Version Planning Strategy

- 3-5 new features every 2-3 months
- Bug fixes and small improvements as needed
- Prioritized by user value and implementation complexity
- Every feature must align with local-first SQLite approach

### Documentation Standards

Each roadmap feature requires:
- Clear description of user benefit
- How it integrates with existing architecture
- Implementation complexity estimate
- Dependencies and prerequisites
- Success criteria

## Current Status: v0.5.0 Complete âœ…

**v0.5.0 has been successfully completed**, delivering a comprehensive financial management platform with:
- 1,680+ comprehensive tests passing
- Money Ratios assessment system (Charles Farrell methodology)
- Advanced tax planning with FIFO calculations
- Complete retirement planning features
- Production-ready performance (<100ms portfolio calculations)

## Next Phase: v0.6.0 Planning

The next development phase will focus on advanced portfolio management and optimization features. See the [Financial Expansion Roadmap](financial-expansion-roadmap.md) for detailed planning of:

1. Advanced portfolio optimization
2. Risk analysis and management
3. Alternative investment tracking
4. Enhanced reporting capabilities

## Contributing to Roadmap

Feature suggestions should:

1. Align with our architectural decisions
2. Avoid duplicating existing specifications
3. Include clear user story and technical approach
4. Consider implementation complexity and maintenance impact

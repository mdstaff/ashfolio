# Archive Documentation

This directory contains historical documentation that is no longer actively maintained but preserved for reference.

## v0.2.0-migration/

Documentation from the database-as-user architecture migration completed in v0.2.0:

- DATABASE_AS_USER_FINAL_STATUS.md - Final status of migration (95% complete)
- CRITICAL_ISSUES_RESOLUTION.md - Critical domain registration issues (resolved)
- QUICK_FIX_CHECKLIST.md - Urgent fixes for domain registration (completed)
- v0.2.0-qa-report.md - Quality assurance testing results for v0.2.0

These documents were crucial during the v0.2.0 migration but are now obsolete as the migration was successfully completed.

## demo-mode/

Demo mode specifications that were proposed but never implemented:

- demo-mode-design-proposal.md - Comprehensive demo mode design
- demo-mode-implementation-examples.md - Technical implementation examples
- demo-mode-tdd-specification.md - TDD approach for demo mode

These were well-designed features but are not part of the current v0.4.x roadmap. They may be reconsidered for future versions.

## Archive Policy

Documents are archived when:

1. The work they describe is completed
2. The features they specify are no longer planned
3. They become obsolete due to architectural changes
4. They're superseded by newer documentation

Archived documents are kept for historical context and may be referenced when working on related features in the future.

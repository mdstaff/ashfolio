# Ashfolio v1.0 Release Strategy - Squash Commit Approach

*Date: August 6, 2025*  
*Current State: v0.25.0 on develop branch (25/29 tasks complete)*

## Executive Summary

Given that all development work has been contained in the `develop` branch and we're approaching production release, a **squash commit strategy** will create a clean v1.0.0 baseline. This approach consolidates the extensive development history into a clean, production-ready main branch.

---

## Current Git State Analysis

### **Branch Structure**
- **develop**: Contains all development work (current branch)
- **main**: Production branch (likely minimal/empty)

### **Development History** 
- Extensive commit history from Phases 1-9 development
- 25/29 tasks complete with comprehensive features
- All core functionality implemented and tested

---

## Proposed Squash Commit Strategy

### **Step 1: Complete Phase 10** (1-3 days remaining)
**âœ… COMPLETED: Task 26.5 - Critical compilation issues fixed**
- âœ… Fixed PubSub implementation 
- âœ… Resolved module aliases and Ash function calls
- âœ… Fixed component attributes and code quality issues
- âœ… Achieved clean compilation (1 minor warning remaining)
- âœ… All 192+ tests continue passing

**ðŸ”„ REMAINING Phase 10 tasks:**
- Task 27: Responsive design & accessibility (WCAG AA)
- Task 28: 100% test coverage completion  
- Task 29: Final integration testing and performance validation

### **Step 2: Pre-Release Cleanup** (1 day)
Clean up the codebase for production:
```bash
# Remove build artifacts
rm -rf _build deps
rm -f phoenix.log data/*.db-shm data/*.db-wal

# Clean up any development files
just format
just test-all  # Ensure all tests pass
```

### **Step 3: Documentation Consolidation**
Create clean v1.0 documentation:

#### **A. Simplify CHANGELOG.md**
Replace extensive development history with:
```markdown
# Changelog

## [1.0.0] - 2025-08-XX

### Added - Complete Portfolio Management System
- âœ… **Account Management**: Create, edit, delete investment accounts with exclusion toggle

- âœ… **Portfolio Dashboard**: Real-time portfolio calculations with holdings table
- âœ… **Manual Price Updates**: Yahoo Finance integration with user-initiated refresh
- âœ… **Dual Calculator Engine**: Portfolio and holdings calculations with FIFO cost basis
- âœ… **Responsive UI**: Phoenix LiveView with mobile-optimized design
- âœ… **Comprehensive Testing**: 192+ automated tests with 100% pass rate
- âœ… **Local SQLite Database**: Privacy-focused local storage with backup utilities

### Technical Foundation
- **Elixir/Phoenix 1.7+**: Modern concurrent web application
- **Ash Framework 3.0+**: Complete business logic layer
- **SQLite + ETS**: Local storage with performance caching
- **Just Task Runner**: Streamlined development workflows

### Supported Platforms
- macOS 12+ (Apple Silicon M1/M2 optimized)
- Single-user local application design
- USD-only financial calculations (Phase 1 scope)

## Pre-v1.0 Development
- Extensive development work completed in phases (see git history pre-squash)
- 25 major development tasks completed
- Comprehensive feature implementation and testing
```

#### **B. Create V1_FEATURES.md**  
Replace VERSION_FEATURES.md with clean v1.0 feature matrix

#### **C. Streamline README.md**
Focus on production installation and usage rather than development

### **Step 4: Git Squash Process**

#### **Option A: Interactive Rebase (Recommended)**
```bash
# Create backup branch
git checkout develop
git branch develop-backup

# Interactive rebase to squash commits
git rebase -i --root

# In the interactive editor, keep first commit as 'pick', change others to 'squash'
# Create comprehensive commit message for v1.0
```

#### **Option B: Fresh Main Branch**
```bash
# Create new orphan branch for clean history
git checkout --orphan main-v1
git add -A
git commit -m "v1.0.0 - Complete Portfolio Management System

Production-ready portfolio management application with:

âœ… Complete Account & Transaction Management (CRUD operations)
âœ… Real-time Portfolio Dashboard with holdings table and P&L calculations  
âœ… Manual Price Updates via Yahoo Finance API integration
âœ… Dual Calculator Engine with FIFO cost basis methodology
âœ… Responsive Phoenix LiveView UI optimized for desktop and mobile
âœ… Comprehensive Test Coverage (192+ tests, 100% pass rate)
âœ… Local SQLite Database with ETS performance caching
âœ… Professional Error Handling and User Experience
âœ… Just Task Runner for streamlined development workflows

Technical Stack:
- Elixir 1.14+ / Phoenix 1.7+ / Ash Framework 3.0+
- SQLite database with AshSqlite adapter
- ETS caching for price data performance
- HTTPoison for Yahoo Finance API integration
- Comprehensive ExUnit test suite with Mox

Platform Support:
- macOS 12+ (Apple Silicon M1/M2 optimized)
- Single-user local application (no authentication)
- USD-only financial calculations (Phase 1 design)

Installation: just dev
Documentation: README.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md

# Replace main branch
git branch -D main 2>/dev/null || true
git branch -m main
```

### **Step 5: Version Tagging Strategy**
```bash
# Tag the squashed commit
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "v1.0.0 - Production Release

Complete portfolio management system ready for production use.
All core features implemented with comprehensive testing."

# Push clean main branch
git push origin main --force-with-lease
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## Consolidated Documentation Strategy

### **Files to Keep (Simplified)**
- `README.md` - Production-focused installation and usage
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Clean v1.0 release notes  
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical architecture (keep existing)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Development guidance (keep existing)

### **Files to Archive/Simplify**  
- `CURRENT_STATE_ANALYSIS.md` â†’ Archive or merge into README
- `VERSION_FEATURES.md` â†’ Simplify to `V1_FEATURES.md`
- `STREAMLINING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` â†’ Archive (completed)
- Extensive development CHANGELOG â†’ Preserve in git history only

### **New v1.0 Documentation**
- `V1_FEATURES.md` - Clean feature matrix for v1.0
- `INSTALLATION.md` - End-user installation guide
- `USER_GUIDE.md` - End-user usage guide
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Distribution and deployment guide

---

## Migration Consolidation for v1.0

As discussed in previous analysis, consolidate 6 development migrations into 2 clean migrations:

```bash
# Create consolidated migrations
001_create_complete_schema.exs     # All tables + relationships + current fields
002_add_performance_indexes.exs    # Keep existing excellent indexing strategy
```

This provides:
- Faster fresh installations
- Cleaner migration history
- Easier maintenance for new developers

---

## Benefits of Squash Commit Approach

### **Clean Production History**
- Single comprehensive commit representing v1.0 state
- Eliminates development iteration noise
- Professional appearance for production repository

### **Simplified Maintenance**
- Clear baseline for future development
- Easier bisecting for bug hunting
- Clean branch strategy going forward

### **Better Documentation**
- Focus on end-user value rather than development process
- Professional presentation for public release
- Streamlined onboarding for new contributors

---

## Implementation Timeline

### **Phase 10 Completion** (2-4 days)
- Complete final tasks 27-29
- Ensure 100% test coverage
- Final UI polish and accessibility

### **Squash Commit Preparation** (1 day)
- Documentation consolidation
- Migration consolidation
- Final cleanup

### **Git History Consolidation** (Half day)
- Execute squash commit strategy
- Create clean main branch
- Tag v1.0.0 release

**Total Timeline to Clean v1.0 Release**: 3-5 days

---

## Post-v1.0 Development Strategy

### **Branch Strategy Going Forward**
- `main`: Production releases only
- `develop`: Feature development (continue current approach)
- `feature/*`: Individual features (optional)

### **Release Strategy**
- Semantic versioning: v1.1.0, v1.2.0, v2.0.0
- Clean release notes focused on user value
- Maintain professional changelog going forward

---

## Recommendation

**Proceed with Option B (Fresh Main Branch)** for cleanest result:

1. âœ… Complete Phase 10 tasks
2. âœ… Consolidate documentation  
3. âœ… Create fresh main branch with comprehensive v1.0 commit
4. âœ… Tag v1.0.0 release
5. âœ… Archive development branch as reference

This creates the cleanest possible v1.0 baseline while preserving development history in branch references.

# v0.6.0 TDD Implementation Complete

**Status**: âœ… Completed 2025-01-13
**Approach**: Test-Driven Development for Corporate Actions Engine

## Implementation Summary

Successfully fixed conditional form fields in Corporate Actions using TDD approach. Core v0.6.0 feature fully functional.

**Issue**: Form showed JavaScript-controlled static fields that didn't work with LiveView
**Solution**: Dynamic server-side conditional rendering based on action type selection
**Result**: All corporate action types (stock splits, dividends, mergers) working correctly

## Critical Fixes Applied

### Test Suite Stabilization
- Fixed BenchmarkAnalyzer mock verification errors
- Resolved YahooFinanceMock redefinition warnings
- Fixed PubSub async test race conditions
- Cleaned up unused variable warnings
- All 1,669 tests passing consistently

### Corporate Actions Engine
- Implemented conditional form logic with LiveView
- Added proper validation for each action type
- Created comprehensive test coverage
- Fixed stock split calculations
- Resolved dividend processing issues

### TDD Process Followed
1. **Red**: Write failing test for conditional form behavior
2. **Green**: Implement minimal LiveView logic to pass test
3. **Refactor**: Clean up form structure and validation
4. **Repeat**: For each action type (split, dividend, merger)

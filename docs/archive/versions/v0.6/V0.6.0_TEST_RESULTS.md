# v0.6.0 Corporate Actions Engine - Playwright Test Results

**Test Date**: 2025-01-13
**Test Environment**: localhost:4000 (Phoenix LiveView)
**Testing Tool**: Playwright MCP

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive UI testing of the v0.6.0 Corporate Actions Engine reveals critical issues with the conditional form logic implementation. While the basic UI structure is functional, the core feature of showing/hiding fields based on action type is **NOT WORKING**.

### üî¥ Critical Issues Found

1. **Conditional Form Fields Not Appearing** - The primary v0.6.0 feature is broken
2. **Form Submission Blocked** - Cannot create corporate actions due to missing required fields
3. **No Validation Error Messages** - Form validation occurs but doesn't display error messages

### ‚úÖ Working Features

1. **Page Navigation** - All pages load correctly
2. **Filter Functionality** - All/Pending/Applied/Reversed filters work with proper styling
3. **Empty States** - Display correctly with appropriate messaging
4. **Form Modal** - Opens and closes properly
5. **Keyboard Navigation** - Tab navigation works through form elements
6. **Basic UI Layout** - All elements render with proper structure

## Detailed Test Results

### 3. Action Type Conditional Logic üî¥ CRITICAL FAILURE

| Test Case | Result | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Stock Split fields appear | ‚ùå FAIL | No split ratio fields shown |

## Screenshots Captured

## Root Cause Analysis

The conditional form logic implementation appears to be missing or improperly connected. The LiveView component is not rendering the conditional fields when action types are selected. This suggests:

1. **Missing LiveView Handler**: The `handle_event` for action type changes may not be updating assigns correctly
2. **Template Logic Error**: The HEEx template may have incorrect conditional rendering
3. **Form Changeset Issue**: The changeset may not include the conditional fields

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix Conditional Field Rendering** - This is the core v0.6.0 feature
   - Review `lib/ashfolio_web/live/corporate_action_live/form_component.ex`
   - Check `handle_event("validate", ...)` for action_type changes
   - Verify template conditionals in the HEEx template

2. **Add Validation Error Messages** - Users need feedback
   - Implement error display in form template
   - Use Phoenix's `error_tag` helper

3. **Complete Form Implementation** - Add missing field groups:
   - Stock Split: `split_ratio_from`, `split_ratio_to`
   - Dividends: `dividend_amount`, `dividend_currency`, `qualified_dividend`
   - Merger: `exchange_ratio`, `cash_consideration`
   - Spinoff: `new_symbol_id`, `exchange_ratio`

### Code Review Focus Areas

```elixir
# Check this pattern in form_component.ex
def handle_event("validate", %{"form" => form_params}, socket) do
  # Should update assigns based on action_type
  action_type = form_params["action_type"]
  socket = assign(socket, :action_type, action_type)
  # ...
end
```

```heex
# Template should have conditionals like:
<%= if @action_type == "stock_split" do %>
  <div class="mt-4">
    <h3>Stock Split Details</h3>
    <!-- Split ratio fields -->
  </div>
<% end %>
```

## Test Coverage Summary

- **Total Test Cases**: 50+
- **Passed**: 30 (60%)
- **Failed**: 15 (30%)
- **Partial**: 5 (10%)

## Conclusion

The v0.6.0 Corporate Actions Engine has a solid foundation with working navigation, filters, and basic form structure. However, the core feature - conditional form logic for different action types - is completely non-functional. This must be fixed before the feature can be considered production-ready.

The issue appears to be in the LiveView implementation rather than the UI layer, as the interface responds to selections but doesn't render the expected fields. This is a blocking issue that prevents any corporate actions from being created.

## Next Steps

1. Fix conditional field rendering in LiveView
2. Add proper validation error messages
3. Re-test all form submission scenarios
4. Test the Actions table functionality once data can be created
5. Perform end-to-end workflow testing

**Test Status**: ‚ùå FAILED - Critical functionality not working
**Recommendation**: Do not release v0.6.0 until conditional form logic is fixed
